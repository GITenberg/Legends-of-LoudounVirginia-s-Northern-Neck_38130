<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>Many causes have contributed to the great upsurge of
interest now manifesting itself in Virginia's romantic
history and in the men and women who made it. If, perhaps,
the greatest and most potent of these forces is the splendid
restoration of Williamsburg, her colonial capital, through the munificence
of Mr. John D. Rockefeller, Jr., of New York, we must not
lose sight of the part played by the reconstruction of her old historic
highways and their tributary roads into the fine modern highway
system which is today the Commonwealth's boast and pride; the
systematic and constructive activities of the Virginia Commission
of Conservation and Development of which the present chairman
is the Hon. Wilbur C. Hall of Loudoun; and the excellent work
done by the Garden Club of Virginia in holding its annual Garden
Week celebration in each spring and the generous permission it obtains,
from so many of the present owners of Virginia's historic old
homes and gardens, for the public to visit and inspect them at that
time and thus capture, if but for the moment, a sense of personal
unity with Virginia's glamourous past.</p>

<p>The increasing flow of visitors to Loudoun and to Leesburg, its
county seat, has developed a steadily growing demand for more information
concerning the County's past and its charming old homes
than has been available in readily accessible form. These visitors,
in their quest, usually call at Leesburg's beautiful Thomas Balch
Library which, during Garden Week, lends its facilities to Virginia's
Garden Clubs for their Loudoun headquarters; and Miss Rebecca
Harrison, its Librarian, has upon occasion found the lack of published
information in convenient form somewhat a handicap in her
always gracious efforts to welcome and inform our growing tide of
visitors. Knowing as she did my lifelong interest in Colonial history
and the lives and family stories of the men and women who
enacted their parts therein (my sole qualification, if such in charity
it may be called, for such a task) she, from time to time, had suggested
that I prepare a book upon Loudoun, the people who built
up the County and the old homes which they erected and in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
they lived. The present volume has been written in an effort to
respond to those requests. When some four years ago the work was
contemplated, it was proposed to make it primarily a small, informal
guidebook to Loudoun's older homes; but as my research into her
earlier days progressed, I became deeply conscious that the people
of Loudoun have forgotten much of her past that tenaciously and
loyally should be remembered; and so the story of the County almost
crowded out, beyond expectation, the story of the homes. It is
hoped that, sometime in the future, another book pertaining wholly
to these old plantations and their owners may be prepared and published.</p>

<p>Although there has been no very recent book devoted to her history,
Loudoun has had her historians within and without her
boundaries and, above all, has been fortunate in attracting the interest
of that outstanding scholar and historian of the Northern
Neck, the late Fairfax Harrison, Esq., whose beautiful country-seat
of Belvoir is near by in the adjoining county of Fauquier. As
the most casual reader of the following pages will quickly recognize,
I have been under constant obligation, in the preparation of this
work, to these earlier writers and can but here sincerely acknowledge
the help I have derived from them.</p>

<p>The first published history of Loudoun was written by Yardley
Taylor, a Quaker of the upper country, prior to 1853 in which year
it made its printed appearance. With it was published a map of
the County prepared by him (for his vocation was that of a land-surveyor)
and both map and book are highly creditable to their
author. The book, however, is not very large and, concerning itself
somewhat extensively with the topography, geology, etc. of the
County, it has less to say of Loudoun's history than its admirers
could wish. The map, embellished with cartouches of old buildings,
was the first county map to be prepared in this part of Virginia and
so accurate was it found to be that it was used by both Federals
and Confederates in the devastating War Between the States. That
war, with its aftermath, set back the cultural activities of Virginia
for a full generation; thus it was not until 1909 that the next Loudoun
history appears, this time by Mr. James W. Head of Leesburg.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
His volume is more comprehensive than Mr. Taylor's but,
again, it covers far more than the County's history, including carefully
prepared surveys of its minerals, soils, farm statistics, commercial
activities, and many other interesting and closely related subjects.
In 1926 Messrs. Patrick A. Deck and Henry Heaton published
their <i>Economic and Social Survey of Loudoun County</i>
which is somewhat similar in its scope to the work of Mr. Head
but not so large a volume. In the meanwhile, however, in 1924,
Mr. Fairfax Harrison, himself a scion of the Fairfax family, had
privately published his comprehensive <i>Landmarks of Old Prince
William</i> covering the early history of all the territory originally
comprised in old Prince William County; and thereby built an
enduring monument to his own erudition and industry that will
stand as long as there remains a man or woman who retains an interest
in the fairest part of the princely Colepeper-Fairfax Proprietary.
It remains a pleasant and grateful memory that I had the
benefit of Mr. Harrison's personal suggestions and advice, as well
as access to the overflowing treasury of his published writings, in
my preparation of this volume.</p>

<p>In addition to the authors named, much help was derived from
Mr. John Alexander Binns' treatise on his agricultural experiments,
from the war-books of Major General Henry Lee, Col. John S. Mosby,
Col. E. V. White, Rev. J. J. Williamson, Captain F. M. Myers
and Mr. Briscoe Goodhart, although in the case of the two latter
authors their writings are measurably impaired by the rancour
which controlled their pens. Dr. E. G. Swem's <i>Virginia Historical
Index</i> was of constant assistance as were the publications of the
Virginia Historical Society, those of the College of William and
Mary and similar historical magazines as well as Virginia's Colonial
records and the records of Loudoun County. The resources of the Library
of Congress, the Smithsonian Institution and those of our little
Thomas Balch Library in Leesburg have all been available to me.
In short, I had intended to append a bibliography of volumes consulted
and relied upon for many of the views hereafter expressed;
but when those volumes grew in number to five or six hundred I
realized that limited space would permit no such project. Therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
I have contented myself with frequently indicating in footnotes the
principal sources from which my information has been derived.</p>

<p>To my acknowledgment of aid obtained from books, pamphlets,
newspapers and magazines, official records and documents, must be
added my appreciation of the help of many friends. Mr. Thomas
M. Fendall of Morrisworth and Leesburg, of distinguished Virginia
background himself, has made such careful and comprehensive
studies of Loudoun's past that he was and is the logical prospective
author of a book thereon; but his modesty equals his industry and
scholarship to the very obvious loss, in this instance, to the County
and its people. From him I have had such constant and constructive
assistance and cheerful response to my frequent appeals that without
his aid this book could not have attained its present form. To Loudoun's
present County Clerk Mr. Edward O. Russell and to his deputy
Miss Nellie Hammerley; to Mrs. John Mason; Mrs. E. B. White
and Miss Elizabeth White of Selma; Mrs. Frederick Page; the Rev.
G. Peyton Craighill, the present Rector of Shelburne Parish; the
Rev. J. S. Montgomery; Miss Lilias Janney; Judge and Mrs. J. R.
H. Alexander of Springwood; Mrs. Ashby Chancellor; Mrs. John
D. Moore; Mr. Frank C. Littleton of Oak Hill, and his long studies
of the history of that estate and of President Monroe; Trial Justice
William A. Metzger; Mr. J. Ross Lintner, Loudoun's County
Agent; Hon. Charles F. Harrison, Commonwealth's Attorney; Mr.
Oscar L. Emerick, Superintendent of Schools, for permission to use
the map of the County prepared by him; Mr. E. Marshall Rust;
Mr. George Carter; Hon. Wilbur C. Hall and his efficient official
staff; Mr. Valta Palma, Curator of the Rare Book Collection of the
Library of Congress, and Mr. Hirst Milhollen of the Fine Arts Division
of the same great institution; Mr. John T. Loomis, Managing
Director of Loudermilk and Co. of Washington, as well as to very
many others, my sincere thanks are again tendered for the valuable
help they all so willingly have given me.</p>

<p>The illustrations used to embellish the text deserve a word of comment.
The portrait of the Right Honourable John Campbell, 4th
Earl of Loudoun, Captain-General of the British forces in America
and Governor-in-Chief of Virginia, in whose honour the County of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
Loudoun was named, is reproduced from an engraving that appeared
in the London Magazine of October, 1757, when Loudoun was at
the height of his career. It was copied from the engraving by Charles
Spooner of an earlier painting of the Earl by the Scotch artist Allan
Ramsay (1713-1784), who later became the principal portrait
painter to King George III and his court. I have in my collection
two copies of this London Magazine engraving, one of which I
found in the hands of a dealer in New York and the other in London.
No other copies, so far as I can learn, have recently been offered
for sale.</p>

<p>The fine portrait of the Right Honourable William Petty-FitzMaurice,
Earl of Shelburne and 1st Marquess of Landsdowne, for
whom Shelburne Parish was named, is by Sir Joshua Reynolds and is
now in the National Portrait Gallery in London to which it was presented
by his son Henry, 3rd Marquess of Landsdowne, K. G., in
June, 1858. I obtained an official photograph of this painting at
the National Portrait Gallery in the summer of 1937, and permission
to reproduce it in this book.</p>

<p>The portrait of Sir Peter Halkett, Baronet, of Pitfiranie, Scotland,
who commanded that part of Braddock's army that passed through
the present Loudoun on its way to the fatal battle near Fort DuQuesne,
is from P. McArdell's engraving of the portrait painted by
Allan Ramsay in 1740, and is considered by me one of my most
fortunate discoveries.</p>

<p>The pictures of Oak Hill in the body of the book and that of the
meeting of the Middleburg Hunt on its spacious lawns, reproduced
on the dust-jacket, are from the extensive collections of Mr. Frank
C. Littleton. The original of the portrait of General George Rust
of Rockland (1788-1857), builder of that cherished family seat in
1822, belongs to and is in the possession of a grandson, Mr. John Y.
Rust of San Angelo, Texas, but a carefully executed copy hangs on
Rockland's walls. During the two administrations of President Andrew
Jackson, General Rust was in command of the United States
Arsenal at nearby Harper's Ferry and for many years he was one of
the most respected and influential of the County's citizens. The photograph
of the original portrait herein used I owe to another grandson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
Mr. E. Marshall Rust of Leesburg and Washington, as I do the
picture of Rockland itself and that of the old John Janney residence
in Leesburg, later so long the home of the late Mr. and Mrs. Thomas
W. Edwards, the latter a sister of Mr. Rust. They were all photographed
in this masterly fashion by Miss Frances Benjamin Johnston
of Washington. The pictures of Foxcroft, Oak Hill and the
old Valley Bank in Leesburg are from the Pictorial Archives of Early
American Architecture in the Division of Fine Arts of the Library
of Congress and the negatives are also the work of Miss Johnston.</p>

<p>Reproduction of the portrait of Nicholas Cresswell, the Journalist,
is due to the courtesy of the Dial Press, of New York, publishers of
the American edition of his journal. The original portrait is owned
by Mr. Samuel Thorneley of Drayton House, near Chichester, West
Sussex, England, a descendant of Cresswell's younger brother, Joseph
Cresswell. The map of Loudoun is based on that prepared by Mr.
Oscar L. Emerick in 1923, and is used by his kind permission.</p>

<p>And now, gentle reader, step with me into the pleasant land of
Loudoun.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Loudoun County, Virginia</span></span>
</div>

<p>The county of Loudoun, as now constituted, is an
area of 525 square miles, lying in the extreme northwesterly
corner of Virginia, in that part of the Old Dominion known
as the Piedmont and of very irregular shape, its upper apex formed
by the Potomac River on the northeast and the Blue Ridge Mountains
on the northwest, pointing northerly. It is a region of equable
climate, with a mean temperature of from 50 to 55 degrees, seldom
falling in winter below fahrenheit zero nor rising above the upper
nineties during its long summer, thus giving a plant-growing season
of about two hundred days in each year.</p>

<p>The county exhibits the typical topography of a true piedmont, a
rolling and undulating land broken by numerous streams and traversed
by four hill-ranges&mdash;the Catoctin, the Bull Run and the Blue
Ridge mountains and the so-called Short Hills. These ranges are of
a ridge-like character, with no outstanding peaks, although occasionally
producing well-rounded, cone-like points. The whole area is
generously well watered not only by the Potomac, flowing for thirty-seven
miles on its border and the latter's tributary Goose Creek
crossing the southern portion of the county, but also by many
smaller creeks or, as they are locally called, "runs"; and by such innumerable
springs of most excellent potable water that few, if any,
of the farm-fields lack a natural water supply for livestock. These
conditions most happily combine to create a climate that for healthfulness
and all year comfortable living is without peer on the eastern
seaboard and, indeed, truthfully may be said to be among the best
and most enjoyable east of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Before the advent of the white man, the land was covered by a
dense forest of oak, hickory, walnut, sycamore, locust, ash, pine,
maple, poplar and other varieties of trees&mdash;not by any means unbroken,
for here and there the Indian tribes that roamed the area,
had burned out great clearings for grazing-grounds to entice the wild
animals they hunted and in which the native grasses then quickly
and indigenously sprang up; attracting particularly the buffalo, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
those days, and at least until as late as 1730, to be found in vast
numbers all through the Piedmont region and always in the forefront
as an unending supply of flesh-food to their Indian hunters.
With the buffalo were great herds of "red and fallow deer" and
wolves, foxes in abundance, bears in the mountains, opossum,
racoons, and, along the streams, otter and beaver (later to be so
greatly valued for their pelts) and whose presence, with that of other
fur-bearing animals, was to have its influence on the history of the
region.</p>

<p>When in 1607 the doughty Captain John Smith&mdash;in writing of
any part of Virginia one sooner or later is certain to shake hands with
that amourous hero&mdash;when Captain Smith made his first voyage to
Virginia and came in contact with her aboriginees, the latter were,
in a broad sense, of several stocks or nations, distinguishable principally
by linguistic affinity and more or less common cultural idiosyncracies
rather than by close alliances; and indeed frequently
appearing to cherish their bitterest enmities among their own blood-kindred.
Along the coast, in what we now know as Tidewater, the
territory running from the Chesapeake to those rocky outcrops
making waterfalls in all the great rivers flowing from Virginia into
the Bay, the Indians were generally of the Algonquin stock, a tribe
covering an enormous territory along the Atlantic seaboard from the
neighborhood of Hudson's Bay southerly to at least the Carolinas but
by no means monopolizing the regions where they were found.</p>

<p>To the north, in what is now New York, centred the Iroquoian
tribes, with ramifications as far south as Virginia and North Carolina.
Among these more southerly Indians of the Iroquoian stock
were the fierce and powerful "Susquehannocks" along the river we
still call by that name who later were to play a prominent rôle in our
Loudoun yet to be; the Nottoways, occupying a part of southeastern
Virginia; the Cherokees, occupying the area in Virginia and North
Carolina west of the Blue Ridge, extending north as far as the Peaks
of Otter near the headquarters of the James; and the Tuskaroras of
famous and bloody memory, who were paramount in North Carolina
until their conquest and all but annihilation by the English in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
1711. What were left of the fiercest and most implacable of the
Tuskaroras after that crushing defeat, retreated to New York where,
as the sixth nation they joined the Iroquois Confederacy of their
near kinsmen of the Long House. A few of the more friendly were
removed to a local reservation in 1717 but gradually, in small parties,
says Mooney, they too moved to join their kindred in the north.</p>

<p>Both Algonquins and Iroquois were to be classed as barbarians
rather than savages. The former have been described as having
generally "found locations in permanent villages surrounded by
extensive cornfields. They were primarily agriculturists or fishermen,
to whom hunting was hardly more than a pastime and who
followed the chase as a serious business only in the interval between
the gathering of one crop and the sowing of the next." The Iroquois,
who found their highest development in their confederacy of the
Five Nations of the Long House in central New York (the Massawomecks
so dreaded by the Powhattans and Manahoacs of Smith's
narratives) were even further advanced. Described by historians
as the Romans of America, they led all other Indians of what is now
the United States in their powers of organization and extraordinary
political development. They lived in cleverly and strongly palisaded
villages and their agricultural activities, falling to the women's share
of tribal work, were probably further advanced than those of any
other Indians north of Mexico. Our earliest knowledge places them
on the banks of the St. Lawrence, in the neighborhood of the present
Montreal, whence they were driven by the neighboring Algonquins.
Their defeat and expulsion to the south bred in them a deep
determination for revenge. In the New York wilderness they developed
and cultivated a passion for ruthless warfare and forming
their famous Confederation somewhere about the year 1570, they
rapidly became the most powerful Indian military force east of the
Mississippi and a sombre threat and terror to the other Indian tribes
far and wide.</p>

<p>In contrast to both Algonquins and Iroquois, the Siouan tribes
who ranged the Piedmont country from the Potomac south, were
primarily nomads&mdash;and nomads, observes Mooney, have short histories.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Modern scholarship inclines to place the origin of the great
Siouan or Dakotan family possibly amidst the eastern foothills of the
southern Alleghanies or at least as far east as Ohio, whence, after a
long period, they probably were driven by the Iroquois and other
enemies beyond the Mississippi. Being essentially nomadic, without
permanent villages and relying on constant hunting for their
food, following their game wherever it might lead, they necessarily
ranged widely and covered broad areas. From the days of the
earliest European invasion, locations of the Iroquois and Algonquin
stock were known, but as the earliest English scouts and adventurers
found no such long established villages in the Piedmont country,
their tendency and following them, that of the early writers and
historians, was to loosely assume that the Indians found there were,
in common with their neighbours, either Algonquins or Iroquois.
Later antiquarians and ethnologists seem to have followed their lead;
with an exasperating paucity of record, tradition or material remains,
there was but little on which to base knowledge of language, whence
racial stock might be deduced. It was not until Horatio Hale announced,
sixty years ago, his discovery of a Siouan language bordering
the Atlantic coast and James Mooney, in 1894, published his
<i>Siouan Tribes of the East</i> that these Indians of the northern Virginia
Piedmont, known to be members of the Manahoac Confederacy,
were identified as of the Siouan stock. They "consisted of perhaps
a dozen tribes of which the names of eight have been preserved.
With the exception of the Stegarake," writes Mooney, "all that is
known of these was recorded by Smith, whose own acquaintance
with them seems to have been limited to an encounter with a large
hunting party in 1608."</p>

<p>As Smith's narrative, after its wont, paints a vivid picture of the
Manahoacs, a picture which almost stands alone in the mist of
conjecture and deductive reasoning making up what is left to us
of them, it is well to quote it in full, bearing always in mind that
while these people were found on the upper Rappahannock, we
have excellent reason to believe that they also occupied all the land
now within the bounds of Loudoun. As allied bands, without fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
habitation, they wandered over the lands between Tidewater and
the Blue Ridge, from the James to the Potomac.</p>

<p>The story is contained in Smith's <i>Generall Historie of Virginia</i>
which states on its title page to be "by Captaine John Smith sometymes
Governor in those Countryes &amp; Admirall of New England."
Chapter VI of the book, from which we quote, is however apparently
signed by Anthony Bagnall, Nathaniel Powell and Anas
Todhill who were three of Smith's companions on this adventure.
Bagnall and Powell were among the six listed as "Gentlemen" in
distinction to an additional six listed as "Souldiers," among the
latter being Todhill.</p>

<p>On the 24th July, 1608, Smith and these twelve men set out
on this second voyage of discovery along the shores of the Chesapeake
Bay. Going as far north as the head of the Bay and the "Susquesahannock's"
river and noting their many findings, they eventually,
upon their return south, came to "the discovery of this river
some call Rapahanock" up which they proceeded, with occasional
brushes with the Indians along its banks. On their third day upon
the river</p>

<p>"Wee sailed so high as our Boat would float, there setting up
crosses, and graving our names in the trees. Our Sentinell saw an
arrowe fall by him, though he had ranged up and downe more than
an houre in digging in the earth, looking of stones, herbs, and
springs, not seeing where a Salvage could well hide himselfe.</p>

<p>"Upon the alarum by that we had recovered our armes, there
was about an hundred nimble Indians skipping from tree to tree,
letting fly their arrows so fast as they could: the trees here served
us for Baricadoes as well as they. But Mosco (their Indian guide)
did us more service than we expected, for having shot away his quiver
of Arrowes, he ran to the Boat for more. The Arrowes of Mosco at the
first made them pause upon the matter, thinking by his bruit and
skipping, there were many Salvages. About halfe an houre this
continued, then they all vanished as suddenly as they approached.
Mosco followed them so farre as he could see us, till they were out
of sight. As we returned there lay a Salvage as dead, shot in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
knee, but taking him up we found he had life, which Mosco seeing,
never was Dog more furious against a Beare, than Mosco was to have
beat out his braines, so we had him to our Boat, where our Chirugian
who went with us to cure our Captaines hurt of the Stingray, so
dressed this Salvage that within an houre after he looked somewhat
chearefully, and did eat and speake. In the meane time we contented
Mosco in helping him to gather up their arrowes, which were an
armefull, whereby he gloried not a little. Then we desired Mosco to
know what he was, and what Countries were beyond the mountaines;
the poore Salvage mildly answered he and all with him were of
Hassinninga, where there are three Kings more like unto them,
namely the King of Stegora, the King of Tauxuntania and the
King of Shakahonea, that were coming to Mohaskahod, which is
onely a hunting Towne, and the bounds betwixt the Kingdom of
the Mannahocks, and the Nantaughtacunds, but hard by where we
were. We demanded why they came in that manner to betray us,
that came to them in peace, and to seeke their loves; he answered
they heard we were a people come from under the world, to take
their world from them. We asked him how many worlds he did
know, he replyed, he knew no more than that which was under the
skie that covered him, which were the Powhattans, with the Monacans,
and the Massawomecks, that were higher up in the mountaines.
Then we asked him what was beyond the mountaines, he answered
the Sunne: but of anything els he knew nothing; because the woods
were not burnt. These and many such questions we demanded,
concerning the Massawomecks, the Monacans, their owne Country,
and where were the Kings of Stegora, Tauxintania, and the
rest. The Monacans he said were their neighbours and friends, and
did dwell as they in the hilly Countries by small rivers, living upon
rootes and fruits, but chiefly by hunting. The Massawomecks did
dwell upon a great water and had many boats, &amp; so many men that
they made warre with all the world. For their Kings, they were
gone every one a severall way with their men on hunting: But
those with him came thither a fishing until they saw us, notwithstanding
they would be altogether at night at Mahaskahod. For
his relation we gave him many toyes, with perswasions to go with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
us, and he as earnestly desired us to stay the coming of those Kings
that for his good usage should be friends with us, for he was brother
to Hassinninga. But Mosco advised us presently to be gone, for they
were all naught, yet we told him we would not till it was night. All
things we made ready to entertain what came, &amp; Mosco was as
dilligent in trimming his arrowes. The night being come we all imbarked,
for the river was so narrow, had it biene light the land on the
one side was so high, they might have done us exceeding much
mischiefe. All this while the K. of Hassinninga was seeking the
rest, and had consultation a good time what to doe. But by their
espies seeing we were gone, it was not long before we heard their
arrowes dropping on every side the Boat; we caused our Salvage to
call unto them, but such a yelling and hallowing they made that
they heard nothing but now and then a peece, ayming for neere as
we could where we heard the most voyces. More than 12 miles
they followed us in this manner; then the day appearing, we found
ourselves in a broad Bay, out of danger of their shot, where we came
to an anchor, and fell to breakfast. Not so much as speaking to them
till the Sunne was risen; being well refreshed, we untyed our
Targets<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> that covered us as a Deck, and all shewed ourselves with
these shields on our armes, and swords in our hands, and also our
prisoner Amoroleck; a long discourse there was betwixt his countrimen
and him, how good we were, how well wee used him, how we
had a Patawomeck with us, loved us as his life, that would have
slaine him had we not preserved him, and that he should have his
liberty would they be but friends; and to doe us any hurt it was impossible.
Upon this they all hung their Bowes and Quivers upon
the trees, and one came swimming aboard us with a Bow tyed on
his head, and another with a Quiver of Arrowes, which they delivered
to our Captaine as a present, the Captaine having used them
so kindly as he could, told them the other three Kings should doe
the like, and then the great King of our world should be their friend,
whose men we were. It was no sooner demanded than performed,
so upon a low Moorish poynt of Land we went to the Shore, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
those foure Kings came and received Amoroleck: nothing they had
but Bowes, Arrowes, Tobacco-bags, and Pipes: what we desired,
none refused to give us, wondering at every thing we had, and
heard we had done: our Pistols they tooke for pipes, which they
much desired, but we did content them with other Commodities,
and so we left foure or five hundred of our merry Mannahocks,
singing, dancing, and making merry and set sayle for Moraughtacund."</p>

<p>The spelling, punctuation and capitalization follow the text of the
first edition (1624) in which, opposite page 41, is a map shewing
apparently the Manahoacs (there spelled "Mannahoacks") in
possession of the present Loudoun and the Monacans south of them,
around the upper waters of the James.</p>

<p>With Smith's return to the mouth of the Rappahannock the mist
descends again upon Loudoun for many years.</p>

<p>In 1669 and 1670, John Lederer made three journeys into the interior
of Virginia. His first journey took him up the York River;
his second, up the James; and the route of his third he describes as
"from the Falls of the Rappahannock River to the top of the Apalataen
Mountains." Although he obtained the consent of Sir William
Berkeley before making his explorations, he seems to have
incurred the ill-will of the Virginians themselves and by them was
forced to flee to Maryland. There he met Sir William Talbot, who
sympathized with and befriended him and translated his story of
his travels from the latin in which it had been written. It was published
in London in 1672 with a "foreword" by Talbot in Lederer's
defense.</p>

<p>Of the "Indians then Inhabiting the western parts of Carolina
and Virginia," Lederer says:</p>

<p>"The Indians now seated in these parts are none of those which
the English removed from Virginia, but a people driven by the
Enemy from the northwest, and invited to sit down here by an
Oracle above four hundred years since, as they pretend for the
ancient inhabitants of Virginia were far more rude and barbarous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
feeding only upon raw flesh and fish, until they taught them to
plant corn, and shewed them the use of it."</p>

<p>Concerning the whole Piedmont region, called by Lederer "The
Highlands" he writes:</p>

<p>"These parts were formerly possessed by the Tacci, alias Dogi,
but they are extinct and the Indians now seated here, are distinguished
into the several nations of Mahoc, Nuntaneuck, alias
Nuntaly, Nahyssan, Sapon, Managog, Mangoack, Akernatatzy
and Monakin &amp;c. One language is common to them all, though
they differ in dialects. The parts inhabited here are pleasant and
fruitful because cleared of wood and laid open to the Sun."</p>

<p>Apparently in Lederer's "Monakins" and "Mangoacks" we may
recognize Smith's "Monacans" and "Mannahocks" or "Mannahoacks";
but on his third or Rappahannock journey he does not
speak of such Indians as he may have actually met. James Mooney
thinks that by that time the Manahoacs may have been driven out
of their earlier hunting grounds. The "Tacci, alias Dogi" described
by Lederer are suggested by Mooney to have been only a mythic
people, a race of monsters or unnatural beings, such as we find in
the mythologies of all tribes and had no relation to the Doeg, named
in the records of the Bacon rebellion in 1676, who were probably a
branch of the Nanticoke.</p>

<p>What became of the Manahoacs? Did their pursuit of the game
they hunted gradually draw them westward or were they, more
probably, driven from the Piedmont country by their terrible foes
the northern Iroquois, aided perhaps by the Susquehannocks who
next appear upon the scene? But before taking up the story of the
Iroquois and Susquehannock influence in Loudoun, we must turn
to the English Kings and their grants of Virginia and particularly
its Northern Neck, that spacious territory lying between the Rappahannock
and Potomac, extending from the Chesapeake to a disputed
western boundary.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>ENGLAND ACQUIRES VIRGINIA</h3>


<p>Mighty in her military strength and with
an all but inexhaustible wealth pouring into her coffers
from her American conquests, Spain stood as a very colossus
over the Europe of the sixteenth century; and England, watching
and fearing her hostile growth, grimly determined that she too,
should have her share of that fabulous new world and its treasure.
So deeply planted and so greatly grew this determination that it
eventually became a part of England's public policy and in June,
1578, the great Elizabeth, with her eyes on the American coast,
issued letters patent to Sir Humphrey Gilbert, and after Gilbert's
death reissued them on the 25th March, 1584, to his half-brother
Sir Walter Raleigh, to discover, have, hold and occupy forever, such
"remote heathern and barbarous lands, countries and territories not
actually possessed by any Christian prince, nor inhabited by Christian
people." As by its terms the new grant was to continue but for
"the space of six yeares and no more," it was clear that advantage of
its provisions should be taken with promptness; and Raleigh was
not a man given to delay or indecision. He had been making his
preparations; hardly more than a month elapsed before an expedition
of two ships captained by Philip Amidas and Arthur Barlow
set sail from England, bound for America. On the 4th of the following
July, having landed on an island off the coast of the present
Carolinas, these men raised the English flag and formally declared
the sovereignty of England and its Queen. They brought home with
them such glowing accounts of their discovery that Elizabeth was
moved to bestow upon all the coast the name of Virginia&mdash;the land
of the Virgin Queen. Two more attempts were made to establish
permanent settlements in the neighborhood and although both
failed, enough had been done to found a claim of English ownership
and dominion, a claim which covered the entire coast from the
French settlements in the north to the Spanish settlements upon
the Florida peninsula, and thus the original Virginia became coextensive
with England's pretensions on the North American continent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
It is true that Spain then claimed the entire coast under a
Papal Bull but Papal Bulls meant very little to Elizabeth or to her
pugnacious sea-rovers. One of the many curiosities of history is that
neither Raleigh nor his captains ever saw the soil of that part of
America which was to become the Virginia we know, nor did the
Queen who named it ever have knowledge of its physical characteristics,
its resources or its inhabitants. In short, Virginia proper was
neither to be discovered nor have its first precarious settlement until
after Elizabeth's death.</p>

<p>After these first abortive attempts to found English settlements
under his patent, Raleigh, on the 7th March, 1589, assigned it and
all his rights thereunder to a company of merchants and adventurers
who were resolved to proceed with the enterprise. These assigns,
after the death of Elizabeth, became the leaders in seeking from
King James I "leave to deduce a colony in Virginia." That monarch,
says Bancroft, "promoted the noble work by readily issuing an ample
patent" and on the 10th day of April, 1606, signed and affixed his
seal to the first Charter of an English colony in America under which
permanent settlement was to be effected. This charter declared the
boundaries of Virginia to extend from the 34th to the 45th parallels
of longitude and authorized the planting of two colonies. The first of
these, to be founded by the London Company, largely made up of
men of that city, was designated a "First Colony" to be established
in the southerly portion of England's claim; the right to establish a
"Second Colony" to be planted in the north, went to the Plymouth
Company, whose membership, headed by Sir Ferdinando Gorges,
Governor of the garrison of Plymouth in Devonshire, came principally
from the west of England. Under this Charter the King named
the first "Council for all matters which shall happen in Virginia;"
under it the London Company dispatched the expedition of three
ships in command of Sir Christopher Newport and having Captain
John Smith among its members; and under it and the Second Charter
(of 1609) the infant colony was governed until, in the year
1624, the Charter was revoked and the Crown took over the affairs
of the Colony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>Until the troubled reign of the first Charles, the growth of Virginia's
population had been very slow. It was not until the defeat of
the Royalists in 1645 by the forces of the Parliament and the King's
execution in January, 1649, that the first great increase in population
occurred. In a pamphlet published in London in that latter
year, by an unknown author, it is stated that her population was at
that time 15,000 English and 300 negroes and these were scattered
along the lower portions of the James and the York and the shores
of the Chesapeake. Then the defeated Cavaliers began to arrive in
such great numbers that by 1670 Sir William Berkeley estimated
that 32,000 free whites, 6,000 indentured servants and 2,000
negroes were there. Many of the old population and the newer arrivals
as well, were pressing northward to the land between the
mouth of Rappahannock and that of the Potomac which in 1647
had been organized into a new county, under the name of Northumberland,
to include all the lands lying between those latter rivers
and running westerly to a still indefinite boundary. This was new
territory recently, and still very sparsely, settled by the English and
even as late as 1670 it was contemporaneously estimated that the
Indians between the two rivers had nearly 200 warriors.</p>

<p>Although the Stuarts had been deposed in England and the
younger Charles forced to fly to the Continent, he was still King in
Virginia with loyal and devoted subjects. It was under such conditions
that Charles, actuated not only by a desire to reward certain
of his Cavalier adherents who were sharing his exile, but also to create
a refuge for others of his followers from the ire and oppression of
the triumphant Roundheads, granted by charter dated the 18th day
of September, 1649, the whole domain between the Rappahannock
and Potomac to seven of his faithful lieges who, during the Civil
War, had fought valiantly in the Stuart cause. These men were described
in the charter, still preserved in the British Museum, as
Ralph Lord Hopton, Baron of Stratton; Henry Lord Jermyn, Baron
of St. Edmund's Bury; John Lord Colepeper, Baron of Thoresway;
Sir John Berkeley, Sir William Morton, Sir Dudley Wyatt and
Thomas Colepeper Esq. And thus, says Fairfax Harrison, "the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
proprietary of the Northern Neck of Virginia came into existence."</p>

<p>He notes that of the patentees Lord Jermyn, after the Restoration,
became Earl of St. Albans and Sir John Berkeley, Baron Berkeley of
Stratton. "The only conditions" quotes Head "attached to the conveyance
of the domain, the equivalent of a principality, were that
one-fifth of all the gold and one-tenth of all the silver, discovered
within its limits should be reserved for the royal use and that a
nominal rent of a few pounds sterling should be paid into the
treasury at Jamestown each year."</p>

<p>But to receive a grant of this splendid Proprietary from a fugitive
and powerless King was one thing and to reduce it to actual possession
was another and very different one. Charles might and did
consider himself King in both England and Virginia and the ruling
Virginians might and did consider themselves his very loyal and
obedient subjects; but unfortunately for the seven Cavalier patentees
of the Northern Neck, the Parliament and Cromwell took a radically
different view of the matter and, even more unfortunately, were in
a position to enforce that view. No sooner had the representatives
of the new Proprietors come to Virginia and were duly welcomed
by the royalist Governor Sir William Berkeley, than a Parliamentary
fleet of warships arrived from England, deposed the Governor, set
up the rule of Parliament in 1652 and abruptly ended, for the time
being, the patentees' hopes of gaining possession of their new grant.</p>

<p>There was little to be done by these Cavaliers while Parliament
and Cromwell ruled. And then the wheel of history, after its fashion,
completed another cycle. On the 3rd September, 1658, Cromwell
died and soon the ruthless and efficient but never very cheerful control
of England by the Puritans came to an end. In 1659 word came
to Virginia of the resignation of Richard Cromwell and the Puritan
Governor Mathews dying about the same time, the Virginia Assembly
in March, 1660, proceeded to elect Sir William Berkeley to be
their Governor again. On the 8th of the following May, Charles II
was proclaimed King in England and in September a royal commission
for Berkeley, already elected by the Assembly, arrived, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Virginians themselves welcoming the restoration of Stuart rule
with great enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The owners of the patent of the Northern Neck believed that
their patience was at length to be rewarded. Again they sent a representative
to Virginia, this time with instructions from King to
Governor to give his aid to the Proprietors to obtain possession of
their domain. But during all the years of their forced inactivity, the
settlement of Virginia had gone on apace. What had been in 1649 a
thinly settled frontier, shewed now a largely increased population and
land grants to these new settlers had been freely issued by Virginia's
government. Many of those newly seated in the Northern Neck
were very influential men and in their opposition to the claims of
the patentees received popular sympathy and encouragement. As a
result, Berkeley found himself confronted by a Council which obstructed
his every effort to carry out the King's instructions and the
endeavours of the Proprietors to gain possession of their grant being
completely blocked, they were obliged to appeal to the home government
for relief. The outcome of negotiations between them and
Francis Moryson, then representing Virginia in London, was that
the patent of 1649 was surrendered by its holders for a new grant
carrying on its face substantial limitations of the earlier patent. This
new grant was dated the 8th day of May, 1669, almost twenty years
after the first, and contained provisions recognizing the title to lands
already seated or occupied under other authority; generally limiting
the Proprietors' title to such other lands as should be "inhabited or
planted" within the ensuing twenty-one years, together with a constructive
recognition of the political jurisdiction of the Virginia government
within the Proprietary.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>This appeared a reasonably satisfactory compromise of the controversy
to both sides. But suddenly in February, 1673, Charles
made a grant of all Virginia to the Earl of Arlington and Lord Colepeper
to hold for thirty-one years at an annual rent of forty shillings
to be paid at Michaelmas. Thus was Virginia rewarded for her faithful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
loyalty to the Stuarts. When the news came to Jamestown the
Colony flamed with resentment and anger; and now Berkeley and
his Council were in hearty accord with the wrathful indignation of
the Colonists. Even though the King had not intended to interfere
with the title of individual planters in possession of their land, his
action threw the whole situation, and particularly in the Northern
Neck, into turmoil and confusion. Exasperation was directed against
the holders of the Charter of 1669 as well as those of 1673 and again
the original patentees appealed to the Privy Council for relief.
Again the King sought to help them but by this time they had
grown weary of the long controversy and indicated their willingness
to sell out their rights to the Colony; before an agreement could be
reached, Bacon's Rebellion flared up and the whole subject was again
in abeyance.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>We must now return to the Indians. The Dutch settlements along
the Hudson had early developed a very lucrative and active trade
with their native neighbours, particularly the Iroquois, who brought
to them furs for which they were given European manufactures,
especially spirits and firearms and when, in 1664, the English conquered
and took possession of these Hudson settlements, they
continued the Dutch trade and friendship with the Iroquois. To
obtain furs, the hunters and warriors of the Five Nations ranged
further and further afield and before long were in bitter conflict with
the Susquehannocks who had their headquarters and principal
stronghold fifty or sixty miles above the present Port Deposit in
Maryland on the east bank of that river from which they derived
their name. They were mighty men and warriors, these Susquehannocks.
All the early English who mention them pay tribute to
their splendid strength and stature. Smith who, it will be remembered,
came in contact with them before his skirmish with the
Manahoacs, said of them that "such great and well proportioned
men are seldom seen, for they seem like giants to the English, yea
to their neighbours." And in 1666 Alsop wrote that the Christian
inhabitants of Maryland regarded them as "the most noble and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
heroic nation of Indians that dwelt upon the confines of America....
Men, women and children both summer and winter went
practically naked," and adds, among other details, that they painted
their faces in red, green, white and black stripes; that the hair of
their heads was black, long and coarse but that the hair growing on
other parts of their bodies was removed by pulling it out hair by
hair; and that some tattooed their bodies, breasts and arms with outlines.
Our American soil, from the beginning, appears to have
favoured the art of the barber and beauty-shop.</p>

<p>From the English in Maryland these Susquehannocks acquired
guns and ammunition and thus were able to hold their own with
their Iroquois foe for over twenty years of the harshest warfare. But
the Iroquois were relentless and though repulsed again and again,
returned year after year to the attack. The Susquehannocks finally
weakened by an epidemic of smallpox, were overcome, the Iroquois
captured their main stronghold and completely overthrew their
power. Fugitive bands of Susquehannocks, nominally friendly to
the English of Maryland and Virginia, then roamed the western
frontiers of those colonies and along both banks of the Potomac,
still harassed by pursuing bands of Senecas.</p>

<p>Under such conditions it was not long before they came in open
conflict with the English settlers, some say through Indian thefts,
others because the English attacked a party of them, mistaking them
for pilfering Algonquin Doegs. The fighting, once begun, spread
rapidly and the settlers on their exposed frontiers, denied practical
assistance by the Virginia Governor Berkeley and his colleagues
(whom rumor said were making such substantial profits from the
Indian trade that they were loath to antagonize the Indians by
sending organized forces against them) turned for leadership to
Nathaniel Bacon, a young planter of gentle birth, not long come out
from England. Bacon was a natural leader, their cause was popular
and soon Virginia found herself in the midst of an Indian war and
a rebellion against the Jamestown government as well. Bacon led
his men to victory over both Indians and Governor but suddenly dying
from a dysentery or from poison&mdash;to this day the cause of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
death is surrounded by uncertainty&mdash;the "rebellion collapsed with
surprising suddenness," his former followers were overcome by the
Governor with the aid of English troops and Berkeley proceeded to
wreak a vindictive and merciless revenge.</p>

<p>Meanwhile knowledge of the turmoil had reached England and
the King sent Commissioners to Virginia to investigate the causes
of the trouble and Berkeley's wholesale executions and confiscations
of estates. These men made a fair report of their findings to the
King, which, added to the many complaints from the families of
Berkeley's victims, caused Charles to exclaim: "As I live, that old
fool has taken more lives in that naked country than I have done
for the murder of my father." In the spring of 1677 the royal order
for Berkeley's removal arrived and he sailed for England in an attempt
to justify himself in an audience with Charles, his departure
being "joyfully celebrated with bonfires and salutes of the cannon"
by the Virginians. But in England he found that the King, resentful
at his abuse of power, avoided meeting him and in July the old man
fell ill and died, his end hastened, it is said, by his vexation and
chagrin over the King's attitude.</p>

<p>Upon the death of Berkeley, the King appointed Lord Colepeper
Governor of Virginia. As he was not ready nor, possibly, inclined to
go immediately to his post, the King issued a special commission to
Sir Herbert Jeffries, who had been one of his emissaries to investigate
Berkeley, as Lieutenant Governor in immediate charge of affairs.
Jeffries ruled until his death in 1678 when he was succeeded by Sir
Henry Chicheley as Deputy Governor under an old Commission
issued to him as early as 1674. Colepeper did not personally take
charge on Virginia's soil until 1680, and then but for a brief period,
soon returning to England and remaining there over two years. It
was not until December, 1682, that we again find him in Virginia.</p>

<p>Colepeper, it will be remembered, was not only by inheritance a
part owner of the patents of 1649 and 1669 to the Northern Neck
but he was coproprietor with Arlington under the grant of 1673 of
all Virginia and now in his own person Governor of the Colony as
well. For good measure, his cousin, Alexander Colepeper, was also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
an owner by inheritance of a share in the grants of 1649 and 1669.
It was apparent that he was in a position at long last to turn his Virginia
interests to account; but in doing so he sought to make the
new dispensation as personally profitable to his rapacious self as possible.
Therefore he opened negotiations with his old associates, by
1681 had succeeded in buying most of them out, and declared himself
sole owner of all these grants, although his cousin still owned his
one-sixth interest. But the King had become annoyed at his conduct
and the stories of his rapacity and, seeking an opportunity to punish
him, seized upon the pretext that he had been absent from his post
without leave. On this charge he, in 1682, was deprived of his office
as Governor. Two years later (1684) Colepeper sold out his rights
under the so-called Arlington Charter of 1673 to the English Crown
for a pension of £600 a year for twenty-one years. He tried also to
sell to Virginia his rights to the Northern Neck under the Charter
of 1669, but in that transaction he was unsuccessful. A curiously
ironic fate seemed intent upon keeping the Northern Neck Proprietary,
reward of Cavalier loyalty and devotion, as an inheritance
for the still unborn sixth Lord Fairfax, scion and representative of
the family of two of the most able of the Parliamentary leaders.</p>

<p>Although Bacon and his men, when they took the field in 1676,
had thoroughly disciplined the Indians in Virginia, the Iroquois and
the Susquehannocks still entered Piedmont and roamed its forests.
The Iroquois are believed to have driven out the Manahoacs and
their kinsmen prior to 1670 and certainly claimed their lands by
conquest; not coveting them for settlement but for hunting and
particularly for such furs as they could trap and collect in a land
plentiful of beaver and otter. The Virginians built forts at the navigation
heads of the great rivers for the protection of settlers; but the
northern Indians passed beyond and between them and not only attacked
the tributary Virginia Algonquin tribes, from time to time,
but were frequently in conflict with the English as well. Lord
Howard of Effingham, successor to Colepeper as Governor, met
Governor Dongan of New York in July, 1684, and with him closed
a treaty with the Iroquois whereby the latter were to call out of Virginia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and Maryland "all their young braves who had been sent
thither for war; they were to observe profound peace with the
friendly Indians; they were to make no incursions upon the whites
in either state; and when they marched southward they were not
to approach near to the heads of the great rivers on which plantations
had been made."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> But the treaty also contained a provision that the
Iroquois, when in Virginia, should "Keep at the Foot of the Mountains"
which seemed to acknowledge their right to be there and so
continued the Indian menace to such settlers as pushed into Piedmont.
Nevertheless the frontier forts of the Virginians were allowed
to fall into disuse, the Colony depending on companies of
armed and mounted rangers to patrol the back country and keep
the Indians in order, and there seemed some prospect of peace
though the outlying plantations, long keyed up to Indian alarms,
remained alert and watchful. However for awhile there was less
Indian trouble in the upper country and then a new alarm occurred,
resulting in the first recorded exploration of the present Loudoun.</p>

<h3>THE PASSING OF THE INDIANS</h3>

</div>

<p>When Smith came to Virginia, there was an Indian
tribe of the Algonquin stock called by him the Nacothtanks,
a name later evolving into Anacostans, which occupied
the land about the present city of Washington and some
years later having moved its principal village southward to the banks
of the Piscataway Creek, thereafter was known by the name of that
stream. A daughter of their so called "Emperor" or Chief, having
been converted to Christianity, married Giles Brent of Maryland
and with him moved across the Potomac to land he acquired on the
north shore of Aquia Creek, then still in a frontier wilderness. The
Susquehannocks, at the time of their outbreak in 1675, had sought
refuge within the fort of the Piscataways but had been refused
asylum, the Piscataways remaining loyal to their Maryland neighbours
and aiding them in the fighting. In consequence the Susquehannocks
bore these lower river Indians bitter hatred. When the
Iroquois completed their conquest of the Susquehannocks and reduced
them to vassalage, they embraced their side of the quarrel.
Toward all the tribes of the east the attitude of the Iroquois was
simple, consistent and uncompromising. Rule or ruin, subjugation
or extinction, was the harsh choice offered and there was no alternative
for these others save in remotest flight. To protect the Piscataways,
the Marylanders gave them a reservation amidst their settlements.
Blocked and perhaps made jealous by this move, the Iroquois
changed from force to guile, seeking every opportunity to turn them
against their Maryland protectors and, it is thought, eventually in
1697, persuading them to move across the Potomac into the forests
of the Virginia piedmont where they camped for a while near what
is now The Plains in Fauquier County. It was not long before white
hunters or friendly Indians brought the news to the settlements and
the Virginians, still having sporadic troubles with the Iroquois and
Susquehannocks in these backwoods, viewed the incursion of another
tribe with great alarm. They immediately sought to induce the newcomers
to return to Maryland but this they suavely, though none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the less stubbornly, refused to do. At length in 1699, feeling the
loss of their normal and accustomed diet of fish, they, of their own
accord, broke up their camp and traversing the forests of the present
Loudoun, settled on what has since been known as Conoy Island in
the Potomac at the Point of Rocks. There had recently occurred
several murders of English settlers by Indians, probably roving Iroquois;
and Stafford County&mdash;which some years before, had come
into existence to cover this upper country and was to include all this
northern piedmont wilderness until through increasing settlement,
it was separately formed into Prince William County in 1731&mdash;was
again in fine ferment over the whole Indian menace. By direction of
Governor Nicholson, the county sent two of its officers, Burr Harrison
of Chipawansic and Giles Vandercastel whose plantation was
on the upper Accotink, to summon the "Emperor" of the Conoy
Piscataways to Williamsburg. Mounted on horseback and, we may
believe well armed, the two intrepid emissaries promptly set out
upon their mission, travelling it is thought, an Indian trail about a
mile or more south of the Potomac, which is in its course approximately
followed by the present Alexandria Pike, and fording as
well as they could the various creeks which run into that stream from
the south. The Governor had ordered that they keep a record of
their journey and a description of their route and the land traversed
and complying with those instructions they wrote the first detailed
description of any part of Loudoun. Their report exactly complied
with the Governor's orders as to its scope and became a document of
primary importance in Loudoun's history. It reads:</p>

<p>"In obedience to His Excellency's command and an order of this
Corte bearing date the 12th day of this Instance, April," (1699)
"We, the subscribers have beene with the Emperor of Piscataway, att
his forte, and did then Comand him, in his Maj'tys name, to
meet his Excellency in a General Assembly of this his Maj'ties most
Ancient Colloney and Dominion of Virginia, the ffirst of May next
or two or three days before, with sume of his great men. As soone
as we had delivered his Excellency's Commands, the Emperor summons
all his Indians thatt was then at the forte&mdash;being in all about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
twenty men. After consultation of almost two oures, they told us
they were very bussey and could not possibly come or goe downe, but
if his Excellency would be pleased to come to him, sume of his great
men should be glad to see him, and then his Ex-lly might speake
whatt he hath to say to him if Excellency could nott come himself,
then to send sume of his great men, ffor he desired nothing butt
peace.</p>

<p>"They live on an Island in the middle of the Potomack River, its
aboutt a mile long or something Better, and aboute a quarter of a
mile wide in the Broaddis place. The forte stands att ye upper End
of the Island butt nott quite ffinished, &amp; theire the Island is nott
above two hundred and ffifty yards over; the bankes are about 12
ffoot high, and very heard to asend. Just at ye lower end of the
Island is a Lower Land, and Little or noe Bank; against the upper
end of the Island two small Island, the one on Marriland side, the
other on this side, which is of about fore acres of Land, &amp; within two
hundred yards of the fforte, the other smaller and sumthing nearer,
both ffirme land, &amp; from the maine to the fforte is aboute foure
hundred yards att Leaste&mdash;not ffordable Excepte in a very dry time;
the fforte is about ffifty or sixty yardes square and theire is Eighteene
Cabbins in the fforte and nine Cabbins without the forte that we
Could see. As for Provitions they have Corne, they have Enuf and
to spare. We saw noe straing Indians, but the Emperor sayes that
the Genekers Lives with them when they att home; also addes that
he had maid peace with all ye Indians Except the ffrench Indians;
and now the ffrench have a minde to Lye still themselves; they
have hired theire Indians to doe mischief. The Distance from
the inhabitance is about seventy miles, as we conceave by our
Journeys. The 16th of this Instance April, we sett out from the
Inhabitance, and ffound a good Track ffor five miles, all the rest
of the days's Jorney very Grubby and hilly, Except sum small
patches, but very well for horses, tho nott good for cartes, and
butt one Runn of any danger in a ffrish, and then very bad; that
night lay at the sugar land, which Judge to be forty miles. The 17th

<p>This "Sugar land" where our emissaries spent the first night of
their journey, and the Sugarland Run passing through and named
from it, are frequently referred to in the early records and the
mouth of the Run became in 1798 the starting point of Loudoun's
corrected southern boundary line with Fairfax. They derived their
name from the groves of sugar maples found growing there which,
with the use of their sap, were well known to the Indians from earliest
times. In 1692 David Strahane "Lieut. of the Rangers of Pottomack"
tells in his journal that while patrolling the upper woods, he
and his men on the 22nd September "Ranged due North till we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
came to a great Runn that made into the sugar land, &amp; we marcht
down it about 6 miles &amp; ther we lay that night." The wording
quite clearly shows that the sugar land was then well known to the
whites.</p>

<p>Although, as their report shews, Vandercastel and Harrison
reached their goal and duly delivered their message, the Piscataways
did not then or later comply with the Governor's pressing invitation.
That their attitude was not prompted by defiance but rather by
worried caution based on their appreciation of the manifold difficulties
of their then relations with the whites, is indicated by the report
of two other English envoys who, later in the same year, were sent
by the authorities to Conoy. These men, Giles Tillett and David
Straughan, kept a journal from which we learn that in November,
1699, they in their turn reached the fort and found that "one Siniker"
(i.e. Seneca or Iroquois) was among the Piscataways who had had
trouble with "strange Indians" who they called Wittowees and that
the "Suscahannes" had captured and brought two of these Wittowees
to the fort. The "Emperor" received the Englishmen very
kindly and told them that he was then willing to "come to live
amongst the English againe but he was afeared the sstrange Indians
would follow them and due mischief amongst the English, and he
should be blamed for it, soe he must content himselfe to live there."
He accused the French of stirring up these "strange Indians" and
"presents his services to the Gove'n'r, and thanks him for his Kindness
to send men to see him to know how he did."</p>

<p>Our friend the Emperor shews his knowledge of statecraft. Doubtless
he continued to find plausible reasons for holding on to Conoy
where he and his people complacently continued to remain until
after the Spotswood-Iroquois Treaty of 1722 which had such a
broad effect on Loudoun and which we shall presently consider.
During this long occupation of the island, the Piscataways finished
building and occupied their fort and village and to this day evidence
of their tenure, in arrowheads and other objects, is still, from time to
time, discovered.</p>

<p>The journey of Harrison and his companion Vandercastel is important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
to Loudoun not only because it resulted in the first known
description of any of the topography of what is now that county,
but also because it marks the first definitely known white exploration
of the locality above the Sugarland Run and while unknown
English hunters may have theretofore penetrated some part of
Loudoun's wilderness, these men were, it is believed, the first whites
<i>named and recorded</i> who ever trod Loudoun's soil above the Sugarland.
Vandercastel's connection with our story then ends; but Burr
Harrison became the progenitor of one of the most prominent and
respected families of the county which has now been identified with
its best life for five generations. He had been baptized in St. Margaret's,
Westminster, in 1637 and came with his father Cuthbert
Harrison of Ancaster, Yorkshire, to Virginia some time prior to
1669 when Burr, with others, patented land on Asmale Creek near
Occoquan. Afterward, but before 1679, he acquired land on the
Chipawansic, presumably from Gerrard Broadhurst. Therefore, to
distinguish him and his descendants from the other numerous and
not necessarily related Virginia Harrisons, he and they were thenceforward
usually known as the Harrisons of Chipawansic. It was not,
however, until 1811 that Burr Harrison's descendants in the male
line took up their permanent residence in Loudoun; in that year the
widow of his great-great-grandson Mathew Harrison moved with
her children to Morrisworth, an estate seven miles southeast of Leesburg,
now the home of Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Fendall, which had
come to her from her family the Ellzeys of Dumfries, and there she
continued to live until her death.</p>

<p>In the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original omits 'year'">year</ins>
1712 another courageous adventurer sought out Conoy.
The Swiss Baron Christopher de Graffenreid had been interested in
forming a colony of Germans, refugees from the lower Palatinate, at
New Bern in North Carolina and also having obtained authority to
make a settlement on the Shenandoah in Virginia's remote frontier,
he proceeded to explore the neighbourhood. He followed the Potomac
up to Conoy Island and drew a map of the surroundings. This
map notes the great number of wild fowl on the river, particularly
at the mouth of Goose Creek. "There is in winter," he wrote, "such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
a prodigious number of swans, geese and ducks on this river from
Canavest to the Falls that the Indians make a trade of their feathers."
Such a description is enough to reduce to envious inanition our
Loudoun Nimrod of today whose occasional reward of a few wild
ducks may at rare intervals reach the hardly hoped for bagging of a
single wild goose, as a rule now far too alert and wary to alight in
their spring and fall flights over the county. The wild swan has,
alas, wholly disappeared.</p>

<p>De Graffenreid's reference to the vast number of wild fowl on the
upper Potomac, in those early days, has abundant confirmation from
others. So numerous were the wild geese that the Indians called
the river above the falls "Cohongarooton" or Goose River and the
English at first gave it the same name; applying the name Potomac
to only so much of the stream as lay between the falls and the bay.
It was not until well after 1730 that the whole river was generally
called by the latter name.</p>

<p>The "Canavest" referred to by de Graffenreid was the village of
the Piscataways on Conoy and in his journal he describes it as "a
very pleasant and enchanting spot about forty miles above the falls
of the Potomac, we found a troop of savages there ... we made
an alliance, however with these Indians of Canavest, a very necessary
thing in connection with the mines which we hoped to find in
that vicinity, as well as on account of the establishment which we
had resolved to make in these parts of our small Bernese colony
which we were waiting for. After that we visited those beautiful
spots of the country, those enchanted islands in the Potomac above
the falls." De Graffenreid's "mines" and "establishments" were to
be over the Blue Ridge in the nearby Shenandoah Valley; but he
shrewdly recognized the advisability of making friends with a tribe
so firmly and strategically planted as he found at the settlement on
Conoy. As to his "enchanted islands," those contiguous to the
Loudoun bank of the Potomac long have had Loudoun owners and
seem to its people to be sentimentally part of her domain; as a matter
of cold fact and colder law, they lie within the bounds of Maryland;
for in 1776 the long dispute over the sovereignty of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Potomac was settled by a clause in Virginia's Constitution of that
year relinquishing jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Two years before de Graffenreid's expedition, there arrived in
Virginia as Lieutenant Governor, Colonel (afterward Sir) Alexander
Spotswood, the most alert, devoted and able ruler the Colony had
had since Smith&mdash;a man "who still enjoys an almost unrivalled
distinction among Virginia's Colonial Governors"<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and, says Howison,
whose "chief advantage consisted in his social and moral character,
in which aspect it would not be easy to find one of whom
might be truly asserted so much that is good and so little that is
evil."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Spotswood came to love Virginia as though it were his
native land and great was the moral debt the Colony, and especially
the counties created from its old frontier, came to owe to his strong
and conscientious administration. Under a vicious practice by that
time obtaining in England, the titular governship of Virginia had
been held, since 1697, by George Hamilton Douglas, Earl of Orkney,
who though never setting foot in the Colony, drew £1,200 of
the annual salary of £2,000 attached to the office until his death in
1737; and thus Spotswood, preëminent among Virginia's rulers,
served but under a lieutenant-governor's commission. A great-grandson
of John Spottiswoode, Archbishop of St. Andrew's and
Lord High Chancellor of Scotland, who lies buried in Henry VII's
Chapel in Westminster Abbey, Spotswood descended from an old
and aristocratic Scottish family, whose progenitor, a cadet of the
great house of Gordon, married an heiress of the ancient race of
Spottiswoode which took its name from the Barony of Spottiswoode
in the Parish of Gordon, County of Berwick. Born in 1676 in
Tangier where his father Robert Spotswood then served as physician
to the English Governor and garrison, Spotswood "a tall robust man
with gnarled and wrinkled face and an air of dignity and power"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
had, in 1704, fought valiantly under Marlborough and had been
desperately wounded in the battle of Blenheim. He brought with
him recognition of the right of Virginians to the writ of Habeas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Corpus, which though, since Magna Carta, the common heritage
of every free-born Englishman, had not theretofore run in Virginia.
Had this been his all, Virginia would have been his debtor; in the
event it was but an augury of many benefactions to follow.</p>

<p>From the first, Spotswood shewed a keen and enlightened interest
in the problems of the frontier. His efforts to expand the settlements
westerly and to subdue the Indians did not always meet with co-operation
from the Virginia legislature, controlled by representatives
of the more protected and densely settled tidewater sections, whose
people, the "Tuckahoes" as they were called, were frequently unresponsive
to the plight of those in the upper country; and from
time to time Spotswood's impatience with his legislators boiled up
into strong and bluntly worded reproof. To one of his assemblies,
recalcitrant in Indian affairs, he addressed his well remembered
words of dismissal: "In fine I cannot but attribute these miscarriages
to the people's mistaken choice of a set of representatives whom
Heaven has not ... endowed with the ordinary qualifications
requisite to legislators; and therefore I dissolve you." A few Spotswoods,
scattered here and there in the seats of the mighty of our
modern America, might not prove inefficacious.</p>

<p>In May, 1717, we find him reporting upon the Indian situation to
Paul Methuen, the then English Secretary of State, that though
the English had carefully kept the terms of Lord Howard's Treaty
of 1685, the Iroquois "had committed divers hostilitys on our
ffrontiers, in 1713 they rob-d our Indian Traders of a considerable
cargo of Goods, the same year they murdered a Gent'n of Acco't near
his out Plantations; they carried away some slaves belonging to our
Inhabitants, and now threaten not only to destroy our Tributary
Indians but the English also in their neighbourhood." He adds that
such conduct requires "some Reparation" and asks the Secretary to
instruct the Governor of New York to cause his Iroquois to "forebear
hostilitys on the King's subjects of the neighbouring Colonies and
likewise any nation of Indians under their protection."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>
<p>Neither by temperament nor training was Spotswood a man to
acquiesce in such conditions. After consulting with and urging co-operation
upon the Governors of Maryland and Pennsylvania, he
set out in the winter of 1717-'18 for New York "to demand something
more substantial than the bare promises of the Chief men of
those Indians, w'ch they are always very liberal of, in expectation of
presents from the English, while at the same time their young men
are committing their usual depredations upon ye Frontiers of these
Southern Governments." He was fortunate in arriving in New
York "very opportunely to prevent the march of a Great Body of
those Indians w'ch I had Advice on the Road was intended chiefly
against the Tributaries of this Governm't, and the Governor of New
York's Messengers overtook them upon their march and obtained
their promise to Abstain from any hostilitys on the English Governments."</p>

<p>It being late in the season for a conference with the Sachems of
the Long House and the New York Assembly being in the "height
of its business and like to make a larger session than ordinary,"
Spotswood arranged, through the Governor of New York, preliminary
negotiations with the Indians and returned to his Virginia.</p>

<p>The discussions thus begun dragged along during the ensuing
five years. At length, in 1721, the Iroquois sent their representatives
to Williamsburg with more definite proposals and in May, 1722,
the General Assembly passed an act reciting in detail the terms on
which the treaty would be made.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Later in the summer Spotswood,
with certain of his Council, went to New York on a man-of-war
and thence proceeding to Albany (where he was joined by the
Governor of Pennsylvania) the new treaty was closed after the usual
endless speech making and other ceremony. By its terms the
Iroquois were prohibited from ever again crossing the Potomac or
the Blue Ridge "without the license or passport of the Governor
or commander-in-chief of the province of New York, for the time
being"; and the Virginia tributary Indians were similarly prohibited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
from crossing the same boundaries. Moreover, there were provisions
that should any Indians&mdash;Iroquois or tributary&mdash;ignore the
prohibition, they were, upon capture and conviction, to be punishable
by death or transportation to the West Indies, there to be sold as
slaves. There was added a clause rewarding him who captured an
Indian found in Virginia without permission, with 1,000 pounds of
tobacco when the latter should be condemned to death; or, if he
should be condemned to transportation, the captor should "have
the benefit of selling and disposing of the said Indian, and have
and receive to his own use, the money arising from such sale."</p>

<p>There was nothing ambiguous in this treaty's terms; the Iroquois
in signing it realized that their Piedmont hunting grounds
were lost to them and that the sportive raids of their war parties
below the Potomac were ended.</p>

<p>And now Spotswood's consulship had reached its end. His
enemies in London and Williamsburg had been industriously intriguing
and upon his return he found he had been superseded. He
had acquired a vast estate of over 45,000 acres in the Piedmont
forests and to settle and improve those lands he proceeded to devote
his great and able energies. But he had far from retired from his
public labours. As Postmaster General for the American Colonies
he, by 1738, developed a regular mail service from New England
to the James; and was about to sail as a major-general on Admiral
Vernon's expeditions against Carthagena when he suddenly died.
He was buried on his estate, Temple Farm, near Yorktown, where
latterly he had made his home. It was in his mansion there, then
owned by his eldest daughter Ann Catherine and her husband
M. Bernard Moore, Senior, that many years later the negotiations
for the surrender of Lord Cornwallis to General Washington closed
the American Revolution.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>SETTLEMENT</h3>


<p>Although Spotswood's treaty, as we now know,
had finally ended the Indian menace in Piedmont, the
Colonists had to be convinced of that fact by reassuring
experience before any great movement to the upper lands would
begin. There had been other treaties and, as they well knew to their
cost, Indian promise and performance were not always consistent.
The first ten years following the treaty, or from 1722 to 1732, are a
twilight zone for Loudoun in which one has to depend on fragmentary
traditions and comparatively few grants as to actual settlement;
but after the latter year the records become increasingly
numerous and tradition more definite and the student stands on
progressively firmer ground. Slowly there grew a steady increase in
trappers and hunters to the cismontane region and then, gradually
and cautiously, the landless men, the poorer whites from the lower
settlements, the redemptioners or indentured servants who had
fulfilled their contracts of service, began to make their way by Indian
trail or through the untravelled woodlands. Very soon, however,
there were purchases of substantial tracts by a more prosperous class
who began to seat themselves upon their new possessions. They
were a rough and sturdy folk, those first poorer arrivals, illiterate for
the most part, bred to primitive conditions of living, many accustomed
from birth to self-reliance in meeting the problems of existence
on a sparsely settled land and wholly ignorant of the relative
comforts of life enjoyed by the prosperous planters in tidewater.
They built their rude cabins of logs in such places as seemed best
to them, paying scant attention to land titles and being in fact, for
the most part, mere squatters on their holdings; and there they
planted small patches of corn and beans which, with the abundant
game in the woods and fish in the streams, provided their liberal
and hearty fare. It has been traditional that these earliest pioneers
found many open spaces burned over before their arrival; for so
prevalent had been the Indian habit of firing the woods, that historians
have suggested that had the coming of the Europeans to Virginia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
been delayed for a few more centuries, its great forests would
have vanished before their arrival. Taylor records that the early
whites found the timber (probably second or younger growth) "far
inferior in size and beauty to what it is at present. Indeed it has been
asserted that in clearing ten acres of land there could hardly be obtained
from it sufficient material to enclose it;" but as he was a
Quaker, living in the midst of the Quaker settlement between the
Catoctin range and the Short Hills in the northern part of the county,
whose people were in habits and daily life somewhat isolated and up
to Taylor's time at least, given to keeping largely to themselves, we
may assume that his tradition applied more particularly to his locality.
However, the present writer, some twenty years ago, while
improving a farm then owned and occupied by him in the Catoctin
hills, about four miles northeast of Leesburg, had occasion to clear
woodland for roads and gardens, he found that none of the larger
trees, many of them oaks, had rings indicating an age of over two
hundred years. Taylor, and following him Head, places the responsibility
of burning the forests upon the hunters (ranging over the
ground before the first settlers) who are said to have fired the underbrush
"the better to secure their quarries;" but it is unquestionable
that the Indians had preceded them in the practice. It will be remembered
that more than a hundred years before, Smith's Manahoacs
could not inform him of conditions <i>beyond</i> the mountains
"because the woods were not burnt;" obviously in contrast to conditions
on the Piedmont side; and Beverly in his history, written in
1705, amply confirms the Indian usage.</p>

<p>Although tradition tells us, and the absence of recorded grants
confirms, that these earliest settlers were mostly squatters, there had
been acquisition of large tracts within present Loudoun from the
Proprietor of the Northern Neck long before their arrival.</p>

<p>In an earlier chapter the title to the Northern Neck has been
traced down to the year 1681 when it vested for the most part in
the second Lord Colepeper and it is now time to continue its history.
Upon Colepeper's death, in 1689, his only child Catherine, with her
mother, inherited the Proprietary. This second Lady Culpeper, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Colepeper as the name was then also spelled, was something of a
character. By birth, it seems, she was Dutch and had inherited from
her own family both a large fortune and an independent spirit, not
infrequently found together; and it was this fortune</p>

<p>"which enabled Lord Colepeper to hold together his large properties,
particularly the vast Northern Neck proprietary in the Colony
of Virginia. It was also her fortune which rescued from bankruptcy
the English property of her son-in-law, the fifth Lord Fairfax....
Lady Colepeper, it appears, never succeeded in mastering the English
language. She both spoke and wrote it very imperfectly."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Lady Culpeper died in 1710. The daughter Catherine had, some
years before, married Thomas, fifth Lord Fairfax, Baron of Cameron
in the peerage of Scotland and, on her mother's death, the grant
rested in them; for in the meanwhile Alexander Colepeper also had
died (1694) and left his one-sixth interest to Lady Margaret Colepeper,
the second Lord's widow. The fifth Lord Fairfax, dying in
1710, left three sons (all of whom later died without issue) and it
was the eldest of these, Thomas, who inherited the title and became
the sixth Lord. This sixth Lord Fairfax had been born in England in
1691 and came later to Virginia, living out his long life as something
of a misogynistic recluse (due, it is said, to an unfortunate love affair
in early life with a mercenary adventuress) at his seat Greenway
Court, then in the wilderness of Frederick County, where he died in
1781. Today his body rests in Christ Church, Winchester. He it was
who became the friend and patron of the youthful George Washington
and who fills so large a part in the history of the Northern
Neck.</p>

<p>The family of Fairfax had long been seated in Yorkshire where
the men were something more than typical English squires, often
rising to positions of much national as well as local importance. It
traced its descent from Richard Fairfax, Lord Chief Justice of England
in the reign of Henry VI. Sir Thomas Fairfax accompanied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Earl of Essex to France and was knighted for bravery in the camp
before Rouen. On the 4th May, 1627, he was created a Baron of
Scotland with the title of Lord Fairfax of Cameron, which not very
glorious honour he purchased for the sum of £1,500.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> His son, Sir
Ferdinando, was a general in the Parliamentary Army during the
English civil war, becoming the second Baron, and the latter's son
Sir Thomas, later third Baron, was commander-in-chief of the Parliamentary
Armies and a most capable soldier. Becoming dissatisfied
with the extreme policies of the Parliamentary party, he resigned
his position in 1650 and was succeeded by Oliver Cromwell. This
third Baron died in 1671, without male issue, and the title then
passed to his cousin Henry, grandson of the first Lord. Upon his
death, in April, 1688, he was succeeded by his son Henry as the
fifth Lord Fairfax who has already been mentioned as the husband
of Catherine Culpeper.</p>

<p>The fifth Lord Fairfax, although his marriage brought the great
Proprietary into the family, seems to have been dissolute and extravagant.
When he died in London, on the 6th of January, 1710, his
affairs were in great disorder and it is said that at that time "his
servant who attended him robbed him of the little money he had
left." His widow, however, was a woman of thrift and character and
intent on guarding her Virginia patrimony for the benefit of her
sons. In 1702 Robert Carter had been appointed local agent for the
Proprietary; but after her husband's death Lady Fairfax became dissatisfied
with his conduct of its affairs and the revenues she was receiving
and appointed in his place Edmund Jenings and Thomas
Lee (then only twenty-one years of age) as resident agents. As
Jenings was unable to go to Virginia at the time, young Lee found
himself for four years in sole charge; and a most conscientious and
capable agent he became and continued until Jenings came to Virginia
in 1717 and took matters into his own hands. This Jenings was
a man of considerable prominence who later was to serve, for a short
time, as acting governor awaiting the arrival of Spotswood. After the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
death of Lady Fairfax, her testamentary trustees "turned again to
Micajah Perry<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> for help and he pursuaded Robert Carter to agree
once more to assume the agency"<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> (1722) which he continued to
hold until his death ten years later. The Virginia office of the estate
then remained closed until 1734 when Lord Fairfax appointed his
cousin William Fairfax (whose son Bryan by his second wife Deborah
Clarke of Salem, Massachusetts, was eventually to succeed to
the title as the eighth Lord and in whose descendants the title still
remains) to act as collector of rents. In 1736 Lord Fairfax himself
assumed the management in Virginia for a short time; once more
the office was closed until in 1739 we find William Fairfax again in
charge, this time with more extensive powers until Lord Fairfax returned
to Virginia in 1745 and took upon himself control for the
rest of his life.</p>

<p>We are thus introduced to two more men who, in themselves and
their families, had paramount rôles to play in and about the territory
now Loudoun; and between whom there was to develop no little
rivalry and conflict of personal ambitions and interests. Lee, himself
between 1717 and 1719 a purchaser of several thousand acres of
wilderness lying on either side of Goose Creek, had been born in
1690 at the family home Mt. Pleasant in Westmoreland County
and eventually became "President<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and Commander-in-Chief" of
Virginia, as he is described in his will. He was a grandson of that
Richard Lee of a family long in possession of the estate of Coton in
Shropshire who, coming to Virginia sometime prior to 1642, first
settled in that part of York which subsequently became Gloucester,
later moved to Northumberland and became the progenitor of a
family ever since of outstanding importance in the Northern Neck
and Virginia. Carter, a later purchaser of land on a truly vast scale,
whose father Colonel John Carter, believed to have been the son of
William Carter of Carstown, Hertfordshire and of the Middle
Temple, had come to Virginia prior to 1649 and first settled in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
upper Norfolk, now Nansemond County, came to wield an even
greater power than his long-time rival. Our Robert Carter, (1663-1732)
the "King Carter" of towering memory, was the second surviving
son, and his residence Corotoman was in Lancaster County.
The descendants of both Lee and Carter continued for many years
to hold great estates in Loudoun. One of Lee's grandsons, Thomas
Ludwell Lee, built Coton (long since vanished) about 1800 and
another grandson Ludwell Lee built about the same time and just
across the highway, the beautiful Belmont, that home of irresistible
charm; while in 1802 George Carter, great-grandson of the mighty
Robert, built and occupied Oatlands. Both Lee and Carter and their
families and the great mansions built in Loudoun by their descendants
will receive later mention.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately for the development of parts of the southern and
southeastern portion of the county, the purchase of these great tracts
by Lee, Carter and others greatly delayed their settlement and this to
the disadvantage of the owners as well as the neighborhood. Even
Lord Fairfax is found setting off to himself large specific tracts.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> It
was their intention to create hereditary landed estates, modelled on
those existing in England and to be farmed by a numerous class of
yeoman tenantry. But as the very type of farmer-settler most desired
as tenants by the great owners came in, they early and strongly
evinced that determination, common to all in the Colonies, to hold
their land in a freehold that could be passed on indefinitely to their
children and thus insure to them the benefit of their parents' industry
and thrift rather than to become tenants for a limited period
of any great estate; and this no matter how advantageous or tempting
the proffered terms of tenancy. Under then existing conditions,
with the supply of new and cheaply purchasable land seemingly inexhaustible
if one had but the determination and courage to push on
to the newer frontier, they went beyond the great manors, as they
came to be called, and seated themselves in the upper lands or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
crossed the Blue Ridge to the Shenandoah Valley. Eventually and
much later, when parts of the manors were sold, it was often in
comparatively large parcels and these and the remaining portions
were, as a rule, farmed with slave labor, a custom practically nonexistent
in the northwest part of the county. Thus the relative thinness
of settlement, persisting to this day, of much of the lower lands
of Loudoun may be attributed not wholly to the fact that the
stronger and more fertile lands lay above Goose Creek but in part to
the social history of those early days as well.</p>

<p>The first specific grant of land in the later Loudoun appears long
before the treaty of 1722. Under date of the 2nd February, 1709,
Captain Daniel McCarty "of the Parish of Cople in the County of
Westmoreland, Esq." obtained title to 2,993 acres "above the falls
of the Potowmack River, beginning on said River side at the lower
end of the Sugar Land Island opposite to the upper part of the rocks
in said River,"<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> apparently for speculation or investment rather than
for immediate occupation; the number and character of the Indians
still to be encountered thereabout made settlement on isolated plantations
or farms far too risky to be inviting to rich or poor. This
Daniel McCarty was the founder of another eminent family of the
Northern Neck which intermarried in early days with many of the
best known of the early Potomac gentry. He subsequently married,
as her second husband, Ann, sister to Thomas Lee already mentioned,
and widow of Colonel William Fitzhugh of Eagle's Nest
in King George County. The joining together of the prominent
families of the lower peninsula began very early and by the closing
years of the eighteenth century had gone so far that almost all were
in very truth "Virginia cousins" of various degrees and through
numerous alliances. Indeed this became so general that the social
status of any family, tracing back to that period and locality, can
generally be determined merely by the test of its affinities.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that the literature of romance has concerned itself
so little with Daniel McCarty. His ancestry, his own life and that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
his descendants unite in offering the richest material but, save in
the traditions of Virginia, he is today all but unknown. He was the
son of Donal, the son of Donough, Earl of Clancarty. Donal was an
officer in the Irish Army that fought against King William and was
ruined with its defeat. The Earl and his descendants were exiled and
Daniel came to Virginia as a youth and settled in Westmoreland
County. The Earls of Clancarty were the heads of a family descended
from Cormac who was King of Munster in 483; and Burke,
the great authority on the British peerage, declares that "few pedigrees
in the British Empire, if any, can be traced to a more remote
or more exalted source" than theirs; while another authority asseverates
that "long before the founders of the oldest royal families
of Europe, before Rudolph acquired the empire of Germany, or a
Bourbon ascended the throne of France, Cormac McCarty ruled
over Munster and the title of King was at least continued in name
in his posterity down to the reign of Elizabeth."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Daniel's eldest son
and heir, Colonel Dennis, married Sarah Ball, first cousin to Mary
Ball, mother of General Washington; and Augustine Washington,
the general's father, named him as one of the executors of his will.
It was another descendant of Captain Daniel who was surviving
principal in the famous McCarty-Mason duel over a century later&mdash;an
event that so profoundly stirred the country and cost the life of
one of the most prominent and beloved citizens of the Loudoun of
that day.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Francis Aubrey became a large purchaser of Loudoun land soon
after the Iroquois evacuation, first obtaining a grant at the mouth of
Broad Run about 1725. Among the tracts he later acquired was a
grant of about 962 acres purchased on the 19th December, 1728
from Lord Fairfax on or near which later he built a home and lived.
Nothing of this early house has survived; but we know that it was
near the "Big Spring" then as now a conspicuous landmark on the
old Carolina Road and about two miles north of the present Leesburg.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Probably "the Chappel above Goose Creek" of the Truro Vestry
books, the Chapel of Ease or convenient neighbourhood church, the
building of which was supervised by him for the Parish, was immediately
adjacent to his home and the location of that structure,
the first church edifice of any kind to be erected within the bounds
of present Loudoun, is known within a fair degree of accuracy and
in 1926 with appropriate ceremonies, was marked with a stone monument.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Hamilton Parish was coextensive with Prince William County
when the latter was created in 1731. By a legislative act of May,
1732, that part of Prince William lying above "the river Ockoquan,
and the Bull Run (a branch thereof) and a course thence to the
Indian thoroughfare of the Blue Ridge of Mountains" (Ashby's
Gap) was set off as Truro Parish and a Parish organization promptly
followed. The new Parish was named for Truro in Cornwall, a
great mining district, for mining was expected to be an important
industry there. The first Vestry meeting was held on the 7th November,
1732; at a meeting held on the 16th April, 1733, an agreement
was made with the Rev. Lawrence De Butts to preach at the
Parish Church and "at the Chappell above Goose Creek" for 8,000
pounds of tobacco, clear of the warehouse charges and abatements.
The chapel was then either contemplated or preliminary work on its
construction may have been begun; it was not finished until 1736.
But during that interval it is obvious, from the Vestry records, that
occasional services were held there&mdash;perhaps at first in the open air
or at the nearby house of Aubrey and thereafter in the unfinished
chapel. At a Vestry meeting held on the 12th October, 1733,
Joseph Johnson was chosen "Reader to the new Church and the
Chappell above Goose Creek.... In the Parish Levy for this year
provision is made for 2,500 pounds of tobacco to Captain Francis
Aubrey toward building the Chapel above Goose Creek, and the
next year the same amount and in 1735, 4,000 pounds for finishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
said chapel."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Thus the construction of the chapel cost the Parish
9,000 pounds of tobacco which about this time seems to have been
valued at eleven shillings per 100 pounds,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> making the money cost
of the chapel about £49&#8243; 10s in Virginia currency or much less in
the more stable money of England. Undoubtedly it was built of
logs from the trees in its immediate vicinity and we may assume
that it was very small.</p>

<p>At a Vestry meeting held on the 18th November, 1735, a payment
of 1,000 pounds of tobacco was ordered made to Samuel Hull,
Clerk of the Chapel above Goose Creek. In a meeting nearly a year
later, on the 11th October, 1736, the Vestry ordered "that the
Reverend Mr. John Holmes Minister of this Parish preach six times
in each year at the Chappell above Goose Creek; and it is also
ordered, that the Sundays he preached at the said Chappell the
sermon shall be taken from the new Church;" but Mr. Holmes'
ministry seems to have been somewhat irregular for at the bottom
of the page is found this note signed by the Rev. Charles Green "the
first regular Rector of Truro Parish":</p>

<p>"The Levity of the members of the Vestry is worth notice. They
applyed to Collo. Colvill &amp; entered an order, 23d Sept. 1734 for
him to procure them a Clergyman from England. By the order on
the other page they gave Cha. Green a title to the Psh. when ordained,
and he had scarcely left the country when they received Mr.
John Holmes into the parish as appears by the above order. N.B.
Mr. Holmes was an Itinerant Preacher without any orders, &amp; recd.
Contrary to Law."</p>

<p>This Dr. Green, for he was a physician before becoming a clergyman,
was "received into, and entertained as Minister" of Truro
Parish at a Vestry meeting held on the 13th day of August, 1737.
At the same meeting it was "ordered that the Churchwardens place
the people that are not already placed, in Pohick and the new
Churches in pews, according to their several ranks and degrees."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Also "Ordered that the Reverend Mr. Charles Green preach four
times in a year only, at the Chappell above Goose Creek. And that
the Sundays he preaches at the Chappell, the sermon shall be taken
from the new Church."</p>

<p>At a meeting on the 3rd October, 1737, the Vestry appropriated
"To Francis Aubrey gent. for finding books for the Chappell 200
pounds tobacco." Also</p>

<p>"Whereas the Rev. Charles Green hath this day agreed with the
Vestry to take the tobacco levied to purchase books for the Chappell
above Goose Creek and ornaments for the Churches, at the rate of
eleven shillings current money per hundred. He by the said agreement
obliging himself to find and provide the said books and ornaments,
being allowed fifty per cent. upon the first cost in accounting
with the Church-Wardens. It is ordered that the collector pay to
the said Green the sum of 8000 pounds of tobacco, it being the
quantity this day levied for the purpose aforesaid."</p>

<p>At a Vestry meeting held on the 15th April, 1745, it was ordered
that Messrs. John West, Ellsey and French view what necessary
repairs were wanting at Goose Creek Chapel and agree with workmen
therefor.</p>

<p>That seems to be the extent of the Truro Parish records concerning
the "Chappell." It is believed to have been in use until about
1812 and thereafter utterly disappeared.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> In 1742 Fairfax County

the Assembly passed an act dividing Truro Parish at Difficult Run
and the upper part became Cameron Parish, in delicate compliment
to the Lord Proprietor's Barony; but most unfortunately the Vestry
book of Cameron, which would be invaluable source material for
the Loudoun student seeking information for the period from 1748
until after the Revolution, seems to have wholly disappeared or
been destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The Chapel had from its beginning until it became

Awbrey of Westmoreland, was an ally and close friend of Thomas
Lee and, from his appearance in what is now Loudoun until his
death in 1741, was of such dominant importance that he has been
called its then "first citizen." When the county of Prince William
was set off from Stafford in 1731, he became a member of its first
Court and, in 1732, "the inspector of the Pohick warehouse and a
member of the Truro Vestry." Two years before his death he became
the Sheriff of Prince William County and, at about the same time,
established the ferry at the Point of Rocks.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

Aubrey's daughter Elizabeth and later removed to lands on the
Potomac above the mouth of the Monocacy which his wife had inherited
from her father. As early as 1758 and probably before, Noland
operated a ferry across the Potomac from his new plantation to
the Maryland side; thus joining the Maryland and Virginia sections
of the Carolina Road, from the earliest days of local history a main
artery of travel between north and south.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> It was in this immediate

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE MELTING POT</h3>


<p>Thus far we have been noting the arrival of Virginians
from Tidewater. Rich or poor, great landowners or squatters,
gentlemen of position and influence or the mere riff-raff of
the settlements, with all the varying gradation between those extremes,
they had at least in common their English blood and traditions
and being the product of Virginia life, either through birth
or years of residence. It is now time to consider other and wholly
dissimilar strains which, during this period of early settlement, were
coming into the newly opened country and which were to have such
a lasting influence on its population.</p>

<p>As early as 1725 there was, it is said, a group of Irish immigrants
which had established itself on the Virginia bank of the Potomac,
opposite the mouth of the Monocacy. This particular cluster had
come from Maryland having, perhaps, been attracted to the large
grant between the Monocacy and the Point of Rocks which, before
1700, had been acquired by the first Charles Carroll, founder of his
family in Maryland who, when he acquired the land on the Monocacy,
was acting as Agent for Maryland's Proprietor, Lord Baltimore.
Later his grandson, another Charles Carroll, inherited the grant,
added greatly thereto, bestowed upon it the name of Carrollton
Manor and in signing the <i>Declaration of Independence</i> as Charles
Carroll of Carrollton, gave it and himself immortality. The Carrolls
were Irish and Roman Catholics; perhaps they had encouraged these
newcomers to go out to their great holdings on the Monocacy where
life could be begun anew and there was less danger of interference
with their religion than in the strongly Protestant east. However,
whether encouraged or not, our particular covey of Irish seem eventually
to have crossed to the Virginia shore and there planted themselves
with small formality and no title. All was wilderness on both
sides of the Potomac. The matter of a legal title was probably the
least of our adventurers' troubles.</p>

<p>In the first half-century following the founding of Jamestown,
few Irish were to be encountered in Virginia. The Colony was overwhelmingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
English with, it is true, occasional Welsh, Irish and
Scotch here and there; but these were accidental and the basic and
dominating race of the settlers was so wholly Anglo-Saxon that the
few others were submerged and lost in the English flood. But between
1653 and 1660, hundreds of unfortunate Irish, resisting
Cromwell, were shipped as political prisoners and little better than
white slaves to Virginia and the other Colonies. Again, after the
defeat in 1690 of James II and his Irish supporters by William III
at the Battle of the Boyne and the resultant Treaty of Limerick the
next year, great numbers of the Irish were banished or condemned
to transportation and of these many were sent to Maryland and Virginia
where as servants or labourers on the land, their services were
in demand. While the majority thus transported were ignorant
peasants, feudal vassals of their lords, the "Kerns and gallowglasses"
of Macaulay, numbers of the nobility and gentry were exiled as
well, of which we have already recorded a prominent example in
Daniel McCarty. Inasmuch as those transported were so treated as
punishment for their uprising in favour of James and against the de
facto English government of William, they were stigmatized as
criminals, although, as shown, their offense was purely political. But
Irish offenders against the penal laws other than political were also
from time to time condemned to transportation and as the demand
for labourers by wealthier planters in Virginia grew and until negro
slaves later were generally available to them, there was also much
kidnapping of wholly innocent Irish who, too, were taken to the
Colonies and sold into servitude. Among this heterogeneous mass
of unfortunates there were undoubtedly many who were disorderly,
depraved and vicious and who, we know, subsequently gave great
trouble to the Virginians; but to classify all the Irish forcibly transported
as criminals or lawless would be as unjust as it would be untrue.
It well may be borne in mind that to most of the English, they
were a strange, impulsive and foreign people and equally or even
more damning, Romanists in an intensely anti-Roman community.
As such, we may well believe, they seldom enjoyed the benefit of a
doubt of their inherent depravity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>The town of Waterford was, according to tradition, founded by
an Irishman, one Asa Moore, who is reputed to have built his, the
first house there in 1732, naming the new settlement for the place
of his nativity. Later it received many English, Scotch-Irish, Germans
and, particularly, Quakers to whom it largely owed the prosperity
and progress it was then to enjoy.</p>

<p>During the interminable wars of the seventeenth century&mdash;in
ghastly refutation as they were of those blissful dreams of the solidarity
of Europe and that international brotherhood of peace and
culture so fondly entertained by the Erasmian school only a few
generations before&mdash;few parts of that same Europe had suffered
more hideously than the land known as the Palatinate along the
Rhine. The so-called Thirty Years War, from 1618 to 1648, brought
devastation particularly to its lower portion. In 1688 its whole territory
was invaded again by the French of Louis XIV&mdash;an invasion
which, for sheer savage brutality to the people there and the inconceivable
atrocities perpetrated on them, is difficult to parallel in the
annals of civilized nations but which, with its certain legacies of distrust
and hatred, is somewhat conveniently forgotten by the professional
French patriot of today. The land was reduced to little more
than a desert and such of its inhabitants as survived, to the utmost
want and privation. For nine years, until the Treaty of Ryswick
(1697), the French scourging of the land ground it to dust. A few
years of quiet followed, in which the poor Palatines sought to restore
their ruined towns and farms but fate seemed resolved on their annihilation.
In 1703 another war, that of the Spanish Succession, broke
out and raged until 1713 and the Palatinate again and again was
overrun by hostile armies. It was during these years and after, that
those left with the breath of life in their bodies appeared to give up
hope of ever again occupying their homeland in peace. A great emigration
began, ten thousand fugitives first going to England where
they were received kindly by Queen Anne and her people and given
much aid; but, in an England where work was none too plentiful,
the Germans soon became an economic and social problem. About
3,800 were sent to Ireland where, in Munster, their descendants are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
still to be found; but many more were sent to America, some to New
York but the greater number to Pennsylvania. In the latter Colony
they were so well received that they sent back word encouraging
others to follow them; and soon the harassed Germans began to arrive
in such swarms that between 40,000 and 50,000 are believed
to have come to Pennsylvania between 1702 and 1727, wholly
changing its complexion. The Colony's Governor, George Thomas,
writing to the Bishop of Exeter in 1747 stated his belief that the
Germans then comprised three-fifths of the population of that Province.
But of the early arrivals many of the most impoverished worked
out toward the cheaper and still wild lands on the then frontier and
thence south through the strong and fertile regions of western Maryland.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Virginia had been encouraging settlements of refugee
Europeans on her frontiers in an effort to form buffer groups between
the inimical French and Indians to the north and the seated parts of
her domain. In 1730 a grant of 10,000 acres on the Shenandoah
River was made to one Stover for settlement by Germans who began
to pour south from Pennsylvania and Maryland and soon the Valley
was taking on that perceptible Teutonic colour with which it is still
dyed.</p>

<p>In 1731 there came to the present Loudoun the first colony of
Germans from the Valley. Of all the early settling it is doubtful if
any was more intelligently planned or more reasonably could anticipate
success. Instead of a few individuals pioneering in haphazard
fashion, there was a compact and homogeneous group of about sixty
families, the men almost without exception artisans of various trades
or peasants skilled in thrifty farming; and their lot had heretofore
been so harsh and their fortune so adverse that the hardships inseparable
from making a new home in the wilderness were, by comparison,
a kindly dispensation of a hitherto hostile fate. On crossing
the Blue Ridge they and those following them settled the land between
the Catoctin Mountains and the Short Hills, north of the
present Morrisonville, which from that time on has been known as
the German Settlement and than which no part of Loudoun has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
been more industriously and providently farmed. Little those early
Teutons spent on luxury or even comfort; a sound and certain living
was their objective and the land and its increase, rather than ornate
dwellings, received their uttermost effort. Even as late as 1853,
Yardley Taylor was moved to record that their "farms are generally
small and well cultivated and the land rates high. This class of population
seldom goes to much expense in building houses ... many
old log houses that are barely tolerable are in use by persons abundantly
able to build better ones." But if their houses were primitive,
the occupants were generally prosperous and free from debt and in
later years comfortable and commodious farmhouses have taken the
place of the earlier cabins. These earliest Germans, having neither
speech nor habits in common with their neighbours, developed a
self-sustained and independent community wholly different and set
off from those of others around them and to this day their locality
measurably carries on its distinctive life.</p>

<p>Following so closely upon the advent of the Germans that there
has arisen some dispute as to which actually entered first, we find
the arrival of the Quakers. "In 1733 Amos Janney left his residence
at the Falls of the Delaware in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and
migrating to Virginia with his family, established himself at Waterford"<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
and many other Quakers soon joined him. Local tradition
places, even earlier than Janney, David Potts (another Pennsylvania
Quaker) as a pioneer in the northern part of the present county but
no record confirms his presence before the 16th November, 1746,
when he leased 866 acres on "Kittockton Run" from Catesby Cocke
for five shillings in hand paid with right of purchase. Legend may
or may not be correct; the earliest settlers, as we have seen, often
seated themselves without title. Both Janney and Potts were founders
of well known families in the county where their descendants
still worthily bear their names. It is definitely known, however, that
soon the Quakers became very numerous; and as ever since they
have been such a conspicuous element in the diversified population<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
of the county, a brief narration of their story and migration is of
interest.</p>

<p>The "Friends" or "Quakers" as they were subsequently called, are
a religious sect founded by George Fox in England in 1647 when he
was but twenty-three years old. They owe their name of Quakers to
their tendency, in their early religious meetings, to have become so
wrought up in individual enthusiasm as to be seized with an
emotional trembling or quaking and the earlier Friends "definitely
asserted that those who did not know quaking and trembling, were
strangers to the experience of Moses, David and other Saints."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
Their characteristic tenets included the doctrine of non-resistance
and opposition to all formalism in religious services and as Fox began
his activities at a time of intense religious fanaticism met by relentless
persecution, it was not long before he and his followers were in open
conflict with the constituted authorities. From proselyting in public
and interrupting conventional religious services, the more extravagant
of the zealots indulged in activities which can only be ascribed to religious
mania and the authorities promptly met their challenge.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
Merciless whippings, dragging at cart-tails, the pillory, branding
with hot irons and even occasional execution were their fate; but in
common with other religious persecution their growth in number
seems to have been coincident with the most vigourous efforts made
to suppress them. Fox, a man of humble birth, with no advantages
of formal education, possessed tireless energy and great bodily vigour
coupled with the assurance of a natural and magnetic evangelist;
and although equally detested by Churchmen and Puritans and in
conflict with every other religious body, his following rapidly grew
throughout England. Journeys by his proselytes to continental
America, the West Indies, Holland, Germany, Austria, Hungary
and Italy left converts where they preached and this was particularly
so in the American Colonies where Fox himself came in 1672.</p>

<p>The first of the Colonies to hear Quaker preaching was Massachusetts
in 1656, but Virginia was a close second; for in the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
year Thomas Thurston and Josiah Cole of Bristol arrived in the Old
Dominion and are said to have made a number of converts before
they were promptly banished. The Quakers were as little welcome
in either Massachusetts or Virginia as in England itself and both
Colonies passed stringent laws for their repression. Virginia ordained
that any shipmaster found guilty of smuggling in Quakers was to
be fined £100 and upon the third return of a Quaker after banishment,
he was to be treated as a felon. But even before the passage of
the English Toleration Act of 1689 the persecution had died down.
By the end of the century they had so increased in number that they
were a major element in Rhode Island, controlled New Jersey and
Delaware and had, under William Penn in 1681, founded and were
supreme in Pennsylvania. Penn declared for liberty of conscience in
the Colony he termed his "experiment," with absolute religious
freedom "for Papists, Protestants, Jews and Turks"&mdash;if not an absolutely
unique, at least a sorely needed attitude in the seventeenth
century religious life. Thence forward Pennsylvania was to be a
great centre of Quakerism and from it mainly but also from Maryland,
New York and other Colonies, as well as directly from Great
Britain, were recruited the Quakers of Loudoun. Undoubtedly the
familiar combination of economic pressure, the cheaper and more
fertile lands of the new settlement and the pioneering spirit inherent
in the British race explains the migration. It is interesting to note
that by 1694 a Quaker had become Governor of South Carolina and
that from 1725 to 1775 there was a constant flow of Friends from
Pennsylvania, New York, New England and Great Britain to that
State. As a main north-and-south highway, the famous Carolina
Road, passed through the Loudoun to be, doubtless many came that
way and we may believe that not a few of those emigrants joined
their coreligionists who they found living in such comfort and prosperity
in their fertile Virginia colony.</p>

<p>The Quakers of Loudoun had with characteristic shrewdness
picked out for their settlement that part of the far-famed Loudoun
Valley, between the Catoctin Hills and the Blue Ridge, that lies in
the central part of the present county&mdash;perhaps the best and most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
fertile land the county boasts; and there the so-called "Quaker
Settlement" continues to the present time. In common with their
German neighbours to the north, they tended to form a more-or-less
compact colony, segregated from the other pioneers. They were
frugal, industrious, far better farmers than their Virginia neighbours;
but between Germans and Quakers no love was lost and, though
each was isolated from the Tidewater element, there was little or no
intermingling. Nevertheless we find them occasionally making
common cause against the slaveholding portion of the community
and, in the next century in the War Between the States, both German
and Quaker adhered to the Federal cause and were, at least for
the time being, more than ever cut off from their then intensely
Confederate neighbours. Time has softened and gradually worn
down these old-time edges of difference and today, perhaps more
than ever before, we find the descendants of these earlier opponents
living in concord and mutual respect.</p>

<p>Our melting-pot is slowly filling. In the Scotch-Irish it now takes
another human ingredient as distinct from the Anglo-Saxon as
were the Germans or Irish but destined to make a major contribution
not only to the new population of the Piedmont but to that of Virginia
generally and the other Colonies as well. They were splendid
pioneering material with the persistent industry and frugality of the
German and Quaker but, unlike them, mixing freely with the other
settlers, planting themselves anywhere and everywhere they found
conditions and lands to their liking and so soon and freely intermarrying
with their Virginia neighbours that their blood today is
found very generally mixed with the older Virginia strain. Concerning
their origin and history there has been much misinformation and
occasionally rather prejudiced and heated argument; but the main
facts are not obscure.</p>

<p>In the sixth century one of the Irish tribes known as the Scotti
or Scots, inhabiting the island then known as Scotia, but which we
now call Ireland, crossed the Irish Sea and made a mass descent on
the west coast of ancient Caledonia; and driving before them the
Picts they found occupying the land, they settled down in possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
of their newly conquered territory, covering roughly the present
Argyle. Five centuries later the descendants of these invaders, having
waxed mightily in power and numbers and become one of the
four tribal kingdoms of Caledonia, united with the others, the Picts,
British and Angles, to make the Kingdom of Scotland to which they
gave their name and of which their history thenceforth was a part.
Thus apparently their future destiny was fixed for all time in Scotland;
but Providence had not forgotten them and had other plans.</p>

<p>In all Ireland, never renowned for its meekness nor pacification,
there was in Elizabethan days and before, probably no part more
constantly and consistently embroiled than the Province of Ulster.
More or less continuous fighting between its people and Elizabeth's
soldiers gradually wore down the Irish and their final complete collapse
came in 1607 when their native princes, the Earls of Tyrconnel
and Tyrone, deserted them and fled to the Continent. Thereupon
the first James of England, having succeeded Elizabeth, declared all
the lands of the Province forfeited and escheated to the English
Crown, thus providing a convenient and legal basis for dispossessing
the native Irish of their holdings, which the King thereupon undertook
to repopulate with English and Scotch. But the English did not
view the King's inducements with enthusiasm. Inasmuch as, in
comparison with the Scotch, they "were a great deal more tenderly
bred at home in England, and entertained in better quarters than
they could find in Ireland, they were unwilling to flock thither except
to good land such as they had before at home, or to good cities
where they might trade, both of which in those days were scarce
enough" in Ulster.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> But the Scotch, many of them from Argyle
found Ulster, their old homeland, to their liking and James, Scotch
himself, seems to have preferred them for his purpose. They came
in great numbers, took root immediately and soon were creating a
peace and prosperity in the Province unknown there for many a long
day, their ranks being later heavily augmented by Covenanters fleeing
from the persecution of Charles I. But between these Presbyterian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
newcomers and the native Irish Roman Catholics, their neighbours,
there was friction and hostility from the beginning which has
lasted unabated to the present day.</p>

<p>Had the English government the wit and policy to have let this
new settlement alone all would have been well; but the England of
those days had yet to learn, from the costly experience of the American
Revolution, that art of governing colonies in which she is today
without peer. After the final crushing of the Irish at the Battle of the
Boyne, in which the new Ulster population was of no small assistance,
the English merchants grew jealous of the trade, manufactures
and aggressive competition of the Province and in 1698 succeeded in
obtaining from Parliament restrictive laws which all but ruined her
industries, particularly in linen and woolen then, as now, outstanding.
And now to the ruin of their trades was to be added religious
coercion. Although, as we have seen, a Toleration Act had been
passed for England in 1689, it was not until nearly one hundred
years later that in 1782 the Toleration Act for Ireland became law.
From 1704 on there was a great effort to force the Presbyterians of
Ulster, as well as those of Scotland, to conform to the English
Church and those who refused were forbidden to keep schools, marriages
performed by their ministers were declared invalid and other
civil disabilities were imposed. By 1719 the people of Ulster had been
made desperate by this senseless interference and persecution and
they, too, began to flock to America. As with the others, the movement,
once started, grew rapidly and in this instance reached such
proportions that it became by far the greatest immigration that, until
the later day of steam, was to come to America's shores. Again
Philadelphia appears to have been the chief port to receive them, as
many as six shiploads landing there in one week alone. Before the
emigration was eased by the Toleration Act and a generally saner
attitude in England, it is estimated that half a million of the Scotch-Irish
had crossed the Atlantic, carrying with them a deep resentment
toward England, for which she later was to pay a heavy price in the
stubborn and valiant support these people and their descendants
gave to the American side in the war of the Revolution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>As most of these Scotch-Irish immigrants were very poor, many
paid for their passage by selling their services and labour for a term
of years, becoming a part of that flood of "indentured servants"
which we shall soon consider. Fairfax Harrison in his <i>Landmarks of
Old Prince William</i> vividly describes their advent and early distribution
in the Northern Neck. As soon as the earlier arrivals had
worked out their contracted years of servitude, Colonel Robert Carter,
about 1723, began seating them around Brent Town and Elk
Marsh. But as their numbers grew, they soon shewed a disinclination
to become tenants, preferring to push further into the wilderness
"where they could and did take up small holdings on the same terms
that Colonel Carter took up his great ones and in that process they
scattered."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Being too poor to purchase negro slaves and the supply
of "redemptioners" or indentured servants by that time beginning
to diminish, they bought the cheaper convicts for labourers and the
Piedmont backwoods of the Proprietary acquired a reputation for
turbulence and lawlessness to which both master and servant contributed
his share. But they settled the land, planted tobacco and
corn as persistently and relentlessly as did their more prosperous
neighbours and in common with them laboured to develop the
future Loudoun.</p>

<p>To understand the status of the "indentured servants," who were
so numerous in the Virginia Colony and were such a large and important
factor in the population of the Northern Neck, it is well to
first consider the meaning of the term. In the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries the word servant was not at all confined to
one who was engaged in a menial task but broadly referred to anyone
who, for compensation, rendered service to another and it was
customary in all occupations, calling for especial training or instruction,
to take on apprentices "bound to serve for a certain time in
consideration of instruction in an art or trade"&mdash;the apprentice to
be fed, lodged and clothed by the master during the term and to
give his labour and services in compensation for his support and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
instruction. This custom obtained not only in the various crafts
and trades but even in the professions as well, lawyers and doctors
taking students on similar terms. In modern England the broader
and older meaning of the word persists in the expression "civil servant"
in reference to a government clerk or employé in what in
America, too, is known as the Civil Service.</p>

<p>Virginia's agriculture was based on the cultivation of tobacco and
corn&mdash;both hand-hoed crops, with practically no use whatever of the
plow. As land was plentiful and the plantations increased in size,
the great and pressing need was always for labor&mdash;and more labor.
This system of indentured service in Virginia began very early and
opened a great supply of labor not otherwise available. There were
many in England of the poorer class and even of those once more
affluent who had for one reason or another become the victims of
misfortune and sought a fresh start in the colonies but were without
the money to pay their passage. No small number of those who had
become bankrupt became indentured servants. The severe English
laws against debtors forced many to fly from that country and
Virginia was a safe escape; for in 1642 a law had been passed in
Virginia protecting these fugitives from their English creditors.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
Little social stigma seems to have attached to the indentured servants
as such. Frequently they lived with the family of their master,
especially so when he was one of the smaller proprietors, and as
they became proficient and earned their master's confidence they
were often made overseers of their fellow workers. Although by far
the greater demand was always for workers on the land, not all of
them were so employed; some were artisans, some of the better
educated became teachers and it was not unusual for the wealthier
planters to seek and purchase these latter for that purpose. George
Washington is said to have thus received his earlier schooling. As
a whole, they appear to have been well and humanely treated in
Virginia, or at least after the earlier days of their introduction, with
little or none of the shocking brutality they are known to have met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
with upon occasion in Maryland, such as called for that Colony's
legislation of 1664, 1681, etc.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>That there had been some earlier harshness, but more probably to
convicts, is suggested by the effort made by Robert Beverley, in his
<i>History of Virginia</i>, first published in 1705, to refute rumours of
ill-treatment or undue hardship in the lives of these people which had
been spread abroad in the England of his day. No doubt the writings
of Defoe and other authors without personal knowledge of what they
undertook to describe, had had their affect. "A white woman is
rarely or never put to work on the ground, if she be good for anything
else," Beverley declares and further on has this to say:</p>

<p>"Because I have heard how strangely cruel and severe the service
of this country is represented in some parts of England, I can't forebear
affirming, that the work of the servants and slaves is no other
that what every common freeman does; neither is any servant required
to do more in a day than his overseer; and I can assure you,
with great truth, that generally their slaves are not worked so hard,
nor so many hours in a day, as the husbandman and day labourer in
England. An overseer is a man, that having served his time, has
acquired the skill and character of an experienced planter, and is
therefore entrusted with direction of the servants and slaves ...
all masters are under the correction and censure of the County
Courts to provide for their servants food and wholesome diet, clothing
and lodging."</p>

<p>And again:</p>

<p>"If a master should be so cruel, as to use his servant ill, that is fallen
sick or lame in his service, and thereby rendered unfit for labor,
he must be removed by the churchwardens out of the way of such
cruelty, and boarded in some good planters home till the time of
his freedom, the charge of which must be laid before the next county
court, which has power to levy the same, from time to time, upon
the goods and chattels of the master, after which, the charge of
such boarding is to come upon the parish in general.... No master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of a servant can make a new bargain for service or other matter with
his servant, without the privity and consent of the County Court, to
prevent the masters over-reaching, or scaring such servant into an
unreasonable compliance."</p>

<p>Moreover, when the servant had redeemed himself by working
out his time, he received from his former master, as assistance to
start out for himself "ten bushels of corn (which is sufficient for
almost a year) two new suits of clothes, both linen and woolen, and
a gun, twenty dollars value"; all of which were given to him as his
due. He had the right to take up fifty acres of unpatented land
and thereupon took his place, according to his merit and industry,
in the free life of the Colony.</p>

<p>The system was necessary from the first; for if the servants had
not been bound they promptly would have secured tracts of land to
work for themselves, leaving those who had paid for their passage
in the lurch. That it was advantageous to both master and servant
is indicated by its growth. Its end in Virginia was caused by a
cheaper labor supply having become available rather than from any
lack of those seeking transportation. It has been estimated that,
between the years 1635 and 1680, from 1,000 to 1,600 came annually
to Virginia under its conditions and that from first to last not
less than eighty thousand persons so arrived. But with the importation
of negroes, beginning on a larger scale about 1680, the custom
declined until by the middle of the eighteenth century, it seems to
have practically ended in Virginia.</p>

<p>The transporting of convicts by England to her American Colonies&mdash;a
far greater injustice to them than the later taxation by which
they were lost to her&mdash;began early and was, in Virginia, at once and
most vigourously opposed; but the everpressing demand for laborers
seems to have rapidly modified the opposition, at least on the
part of the larger proprietors whose power and influence was out of
all proportion to their number; and it was not long before convicts
were not only accepted without protest but even sought. It is the old
story, in America as elsewhere, of a selfish economic advantage
blinding those in power to the welfare of the State as a whole, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
many continued to hold misgivings of the outcome. Thus
we find Beverley in a later edition of his history, recording: "as for
malefactors condemned to transportation, the greedy planters will
always buy them, yet it is to be feared that they will be very injurious
to the Country, which has already suffered many murders and robberies,
the effect of that new law of England."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>But a loose assumption that all the convicts or prisoners arriving
were moral derelicts, or those whose offense essentially involved
moral depravity, and that the proportion these bore to others leaving
Europe for Virginia fixes the ratio of their descendants or influence
in the Old Dominion's later population, would be wholly and
demonstrably untrue. We must be much more discerning and
analytical than that and, as in another instance, look to our
definitions.</p>

<p>The penal law of England, in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries, was far more severe than today. Literally scores of offenses
were punishable by death or transportation which today are
either not crimes or, if still so considered, are punishable only by fine
or imprisonment. Among the transgressions most severely dealt
with, were purely political offenses; and a political offense was
essentially to have picked the wrong side in the many religious,
dynastic or civic disturbances of the period. After the various
Irish upheavals of the seventeenth century&mdash;and that island, it may
be said, was conquered by the English no less than three times within
less than a hundred years&mdash;there was banishment or transportation
of many of the losing side. The transportation was especially
ruthless after Cromwell's operations and again, a generation or
more later, after the Battle of the Boyne. But the Irish were not
the only political victims. When the forces of Parliament defeated
the Stuart followers, they condemned to transportation a goodly
number of their opponents; treatment which was promptly reciprocated
by the triumphant Royalists after the Restoration who meted
out the same punishment to former Cromwellian soldiers and non-conformists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
as well. Again, after the abortive effort made in 1685
by the Duke of Monmouth to seize his uncle's crown, the vicious
and bloody Jeffries and his colleagues, in their less frenzied moments,
sentenced, as criminals, multitudes of the unfortunate followers of
Monmouth to transportation to Virginia&mdash;there to be sold into as
virtual slavery as any thug convicted of murder or highway robbery
who had, in one way or another, been lucky enough to escape hanging.
On arrival they sold for from £10 to £15 each; and we find
the King adding his gentle touch to the work. "Take all care"
wrote James to the Council of Virginia "that they shall serve for
ten years at least; and that they be not permitted to return themselves
by money or otherwise until that term be fully expired. Prepare
a bill for the Assembly of our Colony, with such clauses as shall
be requisite for that purpose." Thus the king; but in four years he
has lost his throne and William III is issuing a full pardon for all
political offenders.</p>

<p>Hence no small part of the convicts were unfortunates, rather
than criminals, to our modern way of thought. But there remained
a large and unpalatable number who had been convicted of crimes
of all degrees and in their ranks were found a motley crew ranging
from the lowest type of profligate, whose escape from the noose had
been a public misfortune, to the minor offenders punished for a first
violation of law. However even this evil residue was fated to leave
but a minor contamination of the Colony's bloodstream. A great
death-toll was taken by sickness on the transporting ships, particularly
by the dreaded "goal distemper" as it was called. Those who
survived the voyage naturally received far less consideration from
their purchasers than was accorded the indentured servant; the unaccustomed
climate took its quota and all in all the mortality was
very great. Of those who outlived their period of servitude, some
rose to positions of trust; many of the incorrigibles soon made the
Colony too hostile for their comfort and took themselves off either
voluntarily or as fugitives&mdash;sometimes to the more remote and unseated
parts of Piedmont or, more generally, to the North Carolina
backwoods, a favorite refuge for the dregs of Virginia's Colonial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
population. And at length, in 1740, came an opportunity for a
great and general house-cleaning. In raising the Virginia levies for
the ill-fated expedition against Carthagena, many a convict was
pressed into service and, in the disasters attending that adventure,
ended his turbulent career. But unfortunately the polluted stream
continued to pour in on Virginia's shores until after the Revolution.</p>

<p>An unduly large proportion of these undesirables appears to have
found its way into the backwoods of the Northern Neck which, in
1730, Governor Gooch described as "a part of the Country remote
from the Seat of Government where the common people are generally
of a more turbulent and unruly disposition than anywhere
else, and are not like to become better by being the Place of all this
Dominion where most of transported Convicts are sold and settled."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
One may, without an undue straining of the imagination, discover
the descendants of some of these people in modern Loudoun's small
lawless element.</p>

<p>The negro slaves were practically confined to the eastern and
southern parts of Loudoun. They were all but unknown in the
German Settlement and the Quakers as a sect were so opposed to
the very institution of slavery that, as early as the eighteenth century,
the Society in America reached the decision to disown any
member thereof who held slaves.</p>

<p>In all this varied assortment of population, it is a tribute to the
natural leadership of the Tidewater Virginian that he maintained
his supremacy and control. From him the county inherits all that is
best and most attractive in its social life&mdash;the courtesy of its people,
the unfailing hospitality, the love of social intercourse, the ardour for
outdoor sports, particularly the devotion to horses, dogs and fox-hunting,
all of which so definitely distinguish it today and contribute
to the outstanding and well-recognized charm of its life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>ROADS AND BOUNDARIES</h3>


<p>We have mentioned in the foregoing pages that
an unusual feature in the settlement of these Stafford or
Prince William backwoods, soon to be known as Loudoun,
was not only the diversity of origin of the new population
but that it came almost simultaneously from the north and the south
and the west as well as from the Tidewater east. As the falls of the
Potomac and Rappahannock blocked continuous water transport
from the older settlements, the pioneers all were forced to come
through the woodland trails and these trails or roads, if they could
be then so called, now demand our attention.</p>

<p>What one might call the Appian Way of Piedmont, the <i>longarum
regina viarum</i> as Statius calls the Roman road, was undoubtedly that
aboriginal trail which, perhaps beginning as a buffalo path,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> was
followed habitually by the Indians in their north-south journeys to
the earliest knowledge of the whites and appears in the records of the
Colony at a very early date. The Carolina Road, as it is best known,
became a great highway between the north and the south and if our
surmise be correct that, in common with so many of our earliest
colonial roads, it owes its origin to a beaten trail made by the heavier
animals of the forest, it was probably used by the Manahoacks and
their predecessor tribes long before the Susquehannocks frequented
it in the latter half of the seventeenth century, not only on their
trading journeys between the Dutch of Manhattan and the Carolina
Indians, but in their war forays as well. The Iroquois of New York,
as we have seen, followed their Susquehannock kindred to Piedmont
and in Spotswood's day it was their ordinary and accustomed route.
We think we get our first record of it among the Susquehannock
"plain paths" noted in the Virginia Act of 1662 and it was sometimes
referred to by that name. Later and from about 1686 until at
least 1742, that part of the road between Brent Town and the Rappahannock
was also known as the "Shenandoah Hunting Path," a
name still occasionally heard; but the popular name was the Carolina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Road with its no less popular descriptive appellation of "The Rogue's
Road" due to the cattle and horse thieves who infested it throughout
the eighteenth century. That these gentry misused the road only,
rather than were residents of the country it traversed, was always
maintained, and apparently with truth, by the Piedmont people;
but so numerous had they become by 1742 that the Assembly
passed an act<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> calling on those driving stock along the public highways
to have in their possession a bill of sale of their cattle and
horses to be exhibited to any justice of the peace when due demand
therefor was made. Yet the rogues still continued to travel their
road until the ebb and wane of its traffic in the early nineteenth century.
Although the records fail to shew that highwaymen plied
their trade on this or other Virginia roads, Loudoun folklore has
held to a belief in their activities as witness the legend concerning
Captain Harper, Loudoun's own Robin Hood:</p>

<p>"This portion through the present Loudoun of the old Carolina
Road was then locally known as 'Rogue's Road' on account of the
many bold robberies committed along its route by the famous gentleman
highwayman of the day, Captain Harper, who regularly patrolled
it and terrorized all those who lived adjacent to it until such
was the fear of this dashing and bold highwayman, that women were
afraid to venture out upon this road alone. A rather pretty story is
related in this connection&mdash;a young Virginia maiden was walking
this road alone one evening about twilight, hurrying from a visit to
a neighbour, when a dashing cavalier rode up and reined his horse
beside her. 'Are you not afraid to walk this road alone on account
of Captain Harper and his band?' he asked. 'No' replied the maiden
'for I have always heard Captain Harper was a gentleman.' The
dashing horseman looked at her a moment and then walked his
horse beside her until she reached the gate leading to her home.
And then raising his hat and bowing he said: 'Captain Harper bids
you good night' and digging the rowels into his steed he vanished as
he came."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The writer omits to mention the local tradition that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Harper, though mercilessly robbing the rich, gave generously to the
poor.</p>

<p>The Carolina Road entered Virginia at a point on the bank of the
Potomac, above the mouth of Maryland's Monocacy, where Noland's
Ferry sometime prior to 1756 became its connecting link with
Maryland; thence it ran in a southeasterly direction somewhere
along the present clay road to Christ Church just south of modern
Lucketts; thence south, following closely the present Leesburg-Point
of Rocks State Highway, through Leesburg over what is
known as King Street (the King's Highway of yesteryear) and
approximately along the present James Monroe Highway (Route 15
of the United States Highway System) to Verts' Corner, thence
along what is still locally called the Carolina Road (or sometimes
the Gleedsville Road) to Goose Creek at Oatlands. The present
hard road from Verts' Corner to Oatlands, now the main road, was
probably built and the old road's traffic at that point diverted about
1830 when the rough pavement of the road was undertaken. From
Goose Creek at Oatlands the old road followed United States Route
15 as at present to the Little River Turnpike, now known as the
Lee-Jackson National Highway, just east of the village of Aldie;
crossing this, it followed what is now but a local and little used
county road which, in its progress south of the county and under
changing conditions, eventually crosses the other great rivers above
their falls line and so on to North Carolina. Along its route the first
church in Loudoun, Aubrey's little log "Chapel of Ease," was
erected at the Big Spring; and later many of the mansions of the
Loudoun gentlefolk, such as the Noland House, Rockland, Springwood,
Selma, Raspberry Plain, Morven, Rokeby, Oatlands, Oak
Hill, and others in due time came to be built and historic "Ordinaries"
or taverns such as that known as West's and later as Lacey's
and towns such as Leesburg and the nearby Aldie grew up. All
through the eighteenth century the flow of its colorful traffic continued
and developed in volume until the founding of the City of
Washington, as the nation's Capital, drew to the east those travelling
between the northern and southern States. And now, over a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
years after the passing of its golden days of activity, there are
rumoured plans to revive the old road as a main north and south
highway and once again, in the not too distant future, we may see its
old life restored, with motors and trucks speeding along its surface
where the old-time foot and horse-travel and Indians and soldiers,
missionaries and traders, drovers honest or otherwise, were wont
slowly to pass.</p>

<p>Nor are the old mansions and towns the only surviving landmarks
along its way. The famous Big Spring still rises in as steady volume
as of yore; the Tuscarora and Goose Creeks, no longer needfully
forded but now spanned by modern concrete bridges, still flow complacently
in their old-time channels and between them, on the west
side of the present road and two and a half miles south of Leesburg,
still stand the old Indian mounds.</p>

<p>These mounds, for there are others scattered to the west of the one
so noticeable from the highway, have always excited local interest
but the present generation has all but forgotten their traditional
story. Somewhere in the neighbourhood of the house of Mr. T. W.
Gaines, on whose land rises the mound nearest the road, or perhaps
over the land where the mounds themselves now stand, there was
fought a hardly contested Indian battle at about the time the first of
the white pioneers were coming into that neighbourhood. Many
years ago the late Mrs. William H. Martin, then a bride recently
come to Leesburg, with the assistance of the late Miss Lizzie Worsley,
who gave a lifetime of study to the past of Leesburg and
Loudoun, carefully gathered up what she then could of the old story
which had been handed down from generation to generation and
incorporated it in a gracefully written "History and Traditions of
Greenway" which was published in the <i>Record</i> of Leesburg, then
edited by her husband.</p>

<p>"Numberless were said to be dead warriors," wrote Mrs. Martin,
"who found their last resting place so far from their native lands
beneath the mounds that were easily distinguishable in the gloom of
the thick forest. This battle had been between the Catawbas of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Carolinas and the Delawares.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> An hereditary enmity existed between
these two tribes, distant as they were, the one from the
other. A large band of Delawares, pushing into the territory of the
Catawbas had severely punished that tribe, and victorious, were
travelling northward to their home. The Catawbas followed and
unexpectedly fell upon them, having overtaken them at the Potomac.
Terrible and swift was their revenge, yet such were the fighting
qualities of the Delawares thus brought to bay, that the Catawbas
were forced to retreat, without prisoners. But when the remaining
Delaware warriors looked upon their dead they saw the flower
of their tribe, stark in death, and too far to be carried to their own
hunting grounds. So there they were buried...."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>The surviving conquerors gathered together the bodies of their
slain tribesmen and over them toiled to erect the mounds that still
stand. The mounds and many hundred acres of surrounding land
were early acquired by the Mead family, who later built nearby
Greenway, and in that family the legend was handed down that in
the springtime of each year, about the anniversary of the battle,
there came through the forest a band of Indians who, when they
reached the mounds, conducted weird mourning rites for their fallen
brethren, made offerings of arrows and food and then disappeared in
the surrounding woods as silently as they came. As the years passed,
the mourners grew fewer and fewer until at length but a solitary
old warrior arrived and held what proved to be the final ceremony.
But the story does not end with those last solitary rites. According
to the Mead family tradition, year after year, as the night fell on the
anniversary of the battle, weird sounds of conflict came from the
Indian mounds though no person or living thing could be seen.</p>

<p>Perhaps of equal antiquity and second only to the Carolina Road
in early importance but in that respect now by far surpassing it, is
the highway roughly paralleling the Potomac, the old Ridge Road
now generally known as the Alexandria Pike. This road also originated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
in an Indian trail, possibly following an earlier buffalo path; it
joined the famous Potomac Path of Tidewater above the ford at
Hunting Creek and it was along its course that we have seen Giles
Vandercastel and Burr Harrison, in 1699, exploring their way on
their mission to Conoy Island. This was the main entrance from
the lower part of the Northern Neck to at least so much of Loudoun
as lies between the Potomac and the Catoctin Hills; and along its
course and that of the Colchester Road to the south came the majority
of the Tidewater settlers. Its route through what later was to
be the Town of Leesburg is marked by Loudoun Street. The late
Charles O. Vandevanter of Leesburg, who made a careful study of
the location of these old roads, believed that originally its course west
of Leesburg followed what is now known as the Dry Mill Road to
Clark's Gap; but there is reason to believe that he was mistaken.
As the road approaches the rise of the Catoctin Hills, it certainly at
one time followed the hollow to the west of the present established
road and upon the land later owned by the author; so running west
of the present Roxbury Hall and on to Clark's Gap, marks of its
old route being still plainly discernible. When the highway was
incorporated in 1831, its route at this point was changed to approximately
its present location to avoid the sharpness of the grade as it
left the little branch now crossed by stone culverts. Remains of the
old road were discovered in 1923 when building the private road to
the house last named. At the foot of the hill and in front of the
present tenant house, rough piking was uncovered and nearby, where
the path leaves the lane to go to the barn, some old brick were dug
up. The late Samuel Norris, who died in 1933 at the age of eighty-four,
said that at this point there once was a cottage where, as he had
heard when a boy from older people, there had lived a man whose
duty it was to care for the extra horses which were attached to the
stage coaches before they began the abrupt rise of the road at that
point in following the hollow northwesterly. From Clark's Gap the
early road followed the present sandclay road to what is now known
as Ely's Corner, past the present Paeonian Springs and Warner's
Cross Roads and Wheatland and Hillsboro to the depression in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Blue Ridge known as Vestal's or Key's Gap&mdash;Gershom Keys having
owned land at that point as early as 1748 and the Vestal family having
operated a ferry across the Shenandoah nearby at least as early
as 1754 and perhaps in 1736; for we know it was in operation at
that time and that one G. Vestal was living in the immediate neighbourhood
then. Washington followed this road on his mission to
Fort du Quesne in 1753 and once again in 1754 as major of that
expedition against the French on the Alleghany (to the command
of which he later succeeded on the illness and death of Colonel Fry),
which resulted in the building and surrender by him of Fort Necessity.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
In the following year it was trodden by that brigade of Braddock's
army which, under the command of Sir Peter Halkett, left
the main body of the troops when that main body crossed the Potomac
over into Maryland at the present Georgetown as is related in
a later chapter.</p>

<p>In an effort to attract the increasing traffic to and from the west,
Leesburg citizens incorporated in 1831 the Leesburg and Snickers'
Gap Turnpike Company which built an improved road north from
Clark's Gap to Snickers' Gap, as the old Williams' Gap had then
come to be called; and this new road (which is the present Alexandria-Winchester
Highway) took the traffic theretofore going
through Vestal's Gap and has since been the northerly main route
across the Blue Ridge.</p>

<p>To carry the old Ridge Road over Broad Run, we know that
there was built, before 1755, one of the earliest highway bridges in
Loudoun's territory of which record has been preserved; for on the
1755 edition of the Fry &amp; Jefferson map a wooden bridge is shewn
at that point. The picturesque stone bridge that now spans the
stream, venerable as it appears, may not have been constructed before
1820, at about which time that part of the road was being improved
by the Leesburg Turnpike Company; nevertheless in eastern Loudoun
it is a popular legend that it was built by George Washington
as a young man and the inhabitants of the neighbourhood firmly
believe that to be true.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>The third of the principal roads of colonial Loudoun is called by
Fairfax Harrison the Colchester Road and is described by him as also,
in its first beginning an Indian path, developed about 1728 by King
Carter and his sons Robin and Charles from the Occoquan below the
falls "past the future sites of Payne's Church and the present Fairfax
Court House all the way to the Frying Pan run."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The Carters
believed that there was copper on certain of their recently acquired
lands and this road was developed to bring the ore to tidewater. It
became known as the Ox Road and a year or so later joined Walter
Griffin's Rolling Road running west across Little Rocky Run and
eventually across Elk Lick and Bull Run, across the Carolina Road
(near which crossing West's Ordinary was built), and so above the
ford over Little River to the Blue Ridge Road to Williams' Gap. It
was over this road that the youthful Washington returned in the
spring of 1748 from his survey with George William Fairfax of the
lands of Lord Fairfax in the valley and thus first set foot in the present
Loudoun; crossing the Blue Ridge at Williams' Gap<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> they proceeded
to William West's house, later to be licensed as West's
Ordinary and still later as Lacey's. Incidentally this old building
and landmark continued to stand until the year 1927 when it was
quite needlessly and most unfortunately torn down.</p>

<p>The Colchester Road continued to be a main thoroughfare up to
about 1806 when the construction of Little River Turnpike diverted
most of its travel and the new road with its branches became the
principal highway system in southern Loudoun.</p>

<p>The Virginia roads in the early days were in terrible condition for
wheeled traffic. Their most earnest defenders can only allege that
they were no worse than other American roads of those days and
better than many, a defense that damns without even the proverbial
faint praise. Englishmen of the period were still asleep in their attitude
toward road building and many of the highways of England
seem to have been as bad as those in America. One peculiarity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the Virginia road was its general lack of side-fencing. Adjacent
property owners were quite apt to run their boundary fences across
the highway, leaving a gate for the traveller to open and pass
through. Curious as this may seem to us, it was not wholly without
its advantage; for where the highway had become a sink-hole of
mud, it thus was possible for the passer-by to make as wide a detour
through adjacent fields or woods as might be necessary to avoid the
obstruction. This throws light upon the effort at Georgetown,
predecessor settlement of the larger Leesburg, to have the course of
the Carolina Road as it passed through that hamlet definitely established
by the court as early as 1742 and again in 1757.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Bridges were few, far between, and primitive. There was, as we
have shewn, a wooden bridge prior to 1755 carrying the Ridge Road
over Broad Run and it is believed that prior to 1739, the same road
crossed Difficult near Colvin Run over a bridge of sorts; but for the
most part fords were used to cross streams, or ferries in the case of
the Potomac and other great rivers. When fords and ferries failed,
the mounted traveller swam his horse across, leaving the wayfarer
on foot to such more precarious adventure as conditions and his
courage offered.</p>

<p>In a preceding chapter we have seen the Vestrymen of Truro
Parish engaged in ecclesiastical affairs committed to their charge;
among their secular duties was to appoint every four years reputable
Freeholders to "perambulate" the Parish, that is to say to travel over
the plantations and farms within it and renew their landmarks.
In Virginia this was called "processioning" but it derived from a
very ancient English practice know as "beating the bounds" believed
to have been brought by Saint Augustine to England from Gaul
where "it may have been derived from the Roman festival of
Terminus, the god of landmarks, to whom cakes and ale were
offered, sports and dancing taking place at the boundaries." In
England we find the "beating of the bounds" observed under Alfred
and Aethelstan, whose laws mention it. In later days, maps still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
being rare, it continued an English parish custom, generally observed
on Ascension Day or during Rogation Week. A procession was
formed, headed by the Priest of the Parish, the Churchwardens and
other Parish dignitaries and followed by a crowd of boys who were
armed with sticks with which they beat the Parish boundary stones
and were sometimes beaten themselves at each marker in order to fix
those markers in their minds and to insure the location of the
boundary stones being remembered through the life of the younger
generation. The procession frequently ended in a "parish-ale" or
feast which doubtlessly assisted in reconciling the boys to it all.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
In earlier days the Priests sought the Divine blessing for the following
harvest on the lands within the parish. But translated to Virginia
the procedure was robbed of much of its formality and many
of its picturesque features and came to apply to renewing the landmarks
of private holdings rather than confirming in memory those
of the Parish bounds. There was a Truro Vestry meeting held on
the 8th October, 1743, to appoint "Processioners," which meeting,
the record states, was pursuant to an order of Fairfax County Court,
Loudoun then being included in Fairfax. The Vestrymen at their
meeting "laid off the said Parish into Precincts and appointed Processioners
in manner following." As the men appointed were representative
men in their neighbourhoods and as the "Precinct" may
be taken to forecast the later division of Loudoun into its Magisterial
Districts of modern days, it is interesting to study so much of
the record as refers to the country above Difficult Run which in a
few years was to be organized as Loudoun:</p>

<p>"That John Trammell and John Harle procession between Difficult
Run and Broad Run; that Anthony Hampton and William
Moore procession between Broad Run and the south side of Goose
Creek as far as the fork of Little River; that Philip Noland and John
Lasswell procession between Goose Creek and Limestone Run as far
as the fork of Little River; that Amos Janney and William Hawling
procession between Limestone Run and the south branch of
Kitoctan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>
<p>"Between the south fork of Kitoctan and Williams Gap, no free
holder in this precinct; between Williams Gap, Ashley's Gap,
the County line and Goose Creek, to the Beaver Dam, and back to
the Gap, no freeholder in this precinct. Between the Beaver Dam
and the north east fork of Goose Creek no freeholder in this precinct."</p>

<p>Level Jackson and Jacob Lasswell were ordered to procession between
the northeast and northwest forks of Goose Creek; John
Middleton and Edward Hews between Little River and Goose
Creek; William West and William Hall Junior between Little River
and Walnut "Cabbin" branch; George Adams and Daniel Diskin
between Walnut Cabbin branch, Broad run and Cub run and Popes
head. The editors of the record add that these Processioners owned
land within their several precincts at that date.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>The statement that there were no freeholders</p>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">(a) between the south fork of "Kitoctan" and Williams Gap; and</p>
<p class="hanging">(b) between Williams Gap, Ashley's Gap, the County line and
Goose Creek to the Beaver Dam and back to the Gap; and</p>
<p class="hanging">(c) between the Beaver Dam and the north east fork of Goose Creek
</p></blockquote>

<p>is interesting. A and C take in parts of the Quaker Settlement.
Also it is traditional in the Osburn family of Loudoun that their
forebears John and Nicholas Osburn, sons of Richard Osburn of
New Jersey and later of Chester County, Pennsylvania, came from
Pennsylvania to the Shenandoah Valley near Harper's Ferry and
thence in 1734 crossed the Blue Ridge and settled on its eastern
foothills near the present Bluemont. It may be that with other
pioneers in the upper lands they occupied their farms at first without
title and later were obliged to buy the lands they had rescued
from the wilderness from the more shrewd and far-sighted land
speculators for we find no grants from the Proprietor to them. Many
of the earliest settlers were in that position. Catesby Cocke and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Benjamin Grayson particularly, took title to great tracts west of the
Catoctin Hills and in 1740 sold their holdings to John Colvil of
Cleesch as will later appear.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Neither Cocke nor Grayson were
settlers in Loudoun. The former was the son of Dr. William Cocke,
Secretary of State and he himself had been successively clerk of the
counties of Stafford, Prince William and Fairfax. Grayson, a Scotch
merchant from Quantico, became the father of Colonel William
Grayson of Revolutionary fame who, with Richard Henry Lee, first
represented Virginia in the United States Senate.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>SPECULATION AND DEVELOPMENT</h3>


<p>In the Quarter century, between 1730 and the
French and Indian War of 1755, the lands of the future Loudoun
became progressively more populous. Although Truro
Parish had been created as recently as 1732, this pressure of incoming
settlers seemed to call for the division, in its turn, of Truro and
in 1748 the government of the Colony set off the upper part of
Truro, beyond Difficult Run, as a new parish which was named
Cameron in delicate compliment to the Lord Proprietor's Scotch
Barony. Most unfortunately, the first vestry book of the new
parish, which would be invaluable source material for the Loudoun
student seeking information for the period from 1748 until the
Revolution, has vanished or been destroyed. The first parson of
Cameron was the Rev. John Andrews, probably the hero of a
convivial incident soon to be related.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Increasing population meant rapidly rising land values, exercising
an irresistible lure to many of the more active speculators
of the Northern Neck. Such men of substance as Aubrey and
Noland were developing the lands they purchased; but in another
class were Benjamin Grayson, Catesby Cocke, George Eskridge, the
wealthy Potomac trader John Colvil of Cleesh, that turbulent
though gifted son of Dublin John Mercer and even William Fairfax
himself, all of whom, so far as Loudoun was concerned, were
active in land ventures rather than development. The Germans we
have met coming over the Blue Ridge were more intent upon subduing
the wilderness than skilled in the niceties of land titles; hence
they, in common with many of the other pioneers, appear to have
frequently omitted to secure grants from the proprietor for their
holdings, giving Cocke, Grayson, Mercer and even Aubrey the
opportunity, knowingly or otherwise, to secure the legal title to the
lands of which they had taken possession.</p>

<p>In 1740 John Colvil bought out Cocke and his colleagues and,
writes Fairfax Harrison "many lesser men and by pre-arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
divided the territory with William Fairfax. Keeping for himself the
lands lying between Catoctin Creek and the Catoctin Ridge and
stretching from the Potomac to Waterford, he conveyed to William
Fairfax 46,466 acres, constituting all the territory on the Potomac
lying between Catoctin Creek and the Shenandoah River, including
the Blue Ridge from Gregory's Gap to Harper's Ferry. The purchaser
divided the property at the Short Hills into two estates, naming
the northern one 'Shannondale' and the southern one 'Piedmont'
and administered them as manors, on leases for three lives. By his
will he left these lands, with his mansion house, Belvoir, to his eldest
son, and the latter in turn, by his will of 1780, entailed them, with
the intention that they should constitute the 'plantation' of Belvoir
House, always to be held with it. But soon after this last will was
written, the success of the American Revolution made it necessary
for George William Fairfax, by codicil, to change his testamentary
dispositions and his proposed entail was never made effective."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>After Colvil had settled with William Fairfax, he still held
16,290 acres along Catoctin Creek, to say nothing of 1,500 acres
on Difficult Run, his plantation on Great Hunting Creek known
as Cleesh and other lands in the Northern Neck. Born at Newcastle-on-Tyne,
he was closely related to the Earl of Tankerville, through
the latter's mother being his first cousin&mdash;a matter in which he
took some pride and which was to be of even more moment to
the Earl; for when Colvil came to make his will in 1755, he left his
plantation Cleesh, then containing about 1,000 acres, to his own
brother, Thomas Colvil, for life with remainder over "to the Right
Honourable the present Earl of Tankerville and his heirs forever"
and also "in consideration of my relation and alliance to the said
Earl of Tankerville son of my father's brother's daughter," he left
to him outright his 16,000 acres of land on the Catoctin, his 1,500
acres on Difficult and his interest in a certain nearby copper mine.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
Thenceforth these lands remained in the Earl's family until after
the Revolution. Thus originated the Earl of Tankerville's title to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
certain Loudoun lands, reference to which occasionally yet is heard.</p>

<p>About 1739 Josias Clapham, of an ancient family of Yorkshire
(which long has been associated with the Fairfaxes there) bought
land near the Point of Rocks and before his death owned much land
in the Northern Neck. He died sometime prior to the 27th December,
1749, when his will, dated the 29th October, 1744, was proven
in Fairfax County. In that will he left</p>

<p>"to my brother's son Josias Clapham two hundred fourty three
Achres of four hundred joyning to Madm. Mason commonly called
the Flat Spring to him and his heirs forever."</p>

<p>A codicil added to the will reads</p>

<p>"I leave my hole real Estate and Parsonable Estate to my brothers
son Josias Clapham and if he dont come in, it is my desire that his
brother Joseph should have it."<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Nicholas Cresswell, the journalist, as we shall see in Chapter XI,
states that the younger Josias lived in Wakefield in Yorkshire and
was much in debt. He decided to "come in" by emigrating to Virginia
and soon appeared on his lands in the upper country. He became
a great leader in Loudoun affairs. Toward the end of his long
life he, in 1796, deeded to his son Samuel the estate later known as
Chestnut Hill and the latter, soon thereafter, built the beautiful
mansion which became another of Loudoun's outstanding and
stately family seats and which still stands, in all its old-time charm,
not far from the Point of Rocks, in one of the most fertile and captivating
regions of Loudoun. Through the marriage of Betsy Price, a
granddaughter of Josias Clapham, to Thomas F. Mason of the
Gunston Hall branch of that family (and therefore cousin to that
Thomson Mason of Raspberry Plain who we are about to meet)
the house and estate, until very recent years, continuously was occupied
by these Mason descendants of Clapham.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>A few years after the death, in 1741, of Francis Aubrey, much of
his great estate lying between the old Ridge Road (where it now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
passes through Leesburg under the name of Loudoun Street) north
to the Limestone Branch and from the Potomac westerly to the
Catoctin Hills, came into the possession of Mrs. Ann Thomson
Mason, widow of the third George of that ilk; thus introducing to
our frontier of that day another of the most prominent of the Tidewater
families and one which also was to play a very notable rôle
in Loudoun for at least a century. This George Mason, at the age
of forty-five, had been drowned while attempting to cross the Potomac
in a sailboat in the year 1735. In 1721 he had married, as his
second wife, Ann Thomson, daughter of Stevens Thomson of
Hollins Hall, Staffordshire, England, who had served as Attorney-General
of Virginia for some years during Queen Anne's reign. He,
in turn, was the son of Sir William Thomson of the Middle Temple,
a Sergeant at Law who, to his credit, in 1680 had had the courage
to act as counsel for the defendants Tasborough and Price in the
malodorous Popish Plot trials of disgraceful memory. By this second
wife, Mason had six or seven children, of whom only three were to
survive him: George his eldest son (for his first wife had been childless)
who later was to build Gunston Hall and become the author of
the famous Bill of Rights; Thomson, later to become at least a part-time
resident of Loudoun and a famous lawyer in his day; and Mary,
who, on the 11th April, 1751, was to marry Samuel Selden of
Salvington in Stafford County, near Fredericksburg. She died at
her mother's plantation Chipawamsic, on the 5th day of January,
1758, leaving two children, Samuel and Mary Mason Selden, the
latter inheriting her Loudoun lands.</p>

<p>When George Mason met his accidental death he left no will.
Under the Colonial law of primogeniture, his extensive holdings of
land therefore went to his eldest son. According to the family historian,
his younger children were left penniless. His widow thereupon
bent all her energies to create an estate for each of them.
Saving what she could, through every available economy and acting
under the advice of her late husband's friends, she acquired "ten
thousand acres of what was then called 'wild lands' in Loudoun
County, for which she paid only a few shillings per acre." She,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
during her lifetime, divided these lands between her two younger
children "for the reason assigned by her that she did not wish her
children to grow up with any sense of inequality among them in
regard to fortune. The investment turned out a most fortunate one,
and she thereby unwittingly made her younger children wealthier
than their elder brother."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>It is thus so many of the beautiful modern estates between Leesburg
and the Limestone Branch trace their title back to the Mason
family. Mrs. Ann Thomson Mason died on the 13th November,
1762, "leaving a reputation among her connections and neighbours
for great prudence and business capacity, united to the charms of an
amiable, womanly, character." Her Rector, friend and relative, the
Rev. John Moncure, described her as "a good woman, a great
woman, and a lovely woman."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Though she planted the Mason line in Loudoun, she herself does
not appear ever to have lived in that rough and for those days remote
frontier country. The actual seating of her line on her large
purchase was left to her son Thomson who, after going to England
to acquire his training in law and being admitted to the Middle
Temple on the 14th August, 1751, as its records show, returned
to Virginia, practiced law at Dumfries, became, perhaps, the most
eminent lawyer of his time at the Virginia Bar and vigourously aided
the American Revolution. He either had improved and extended
the first Raspberry Plain home or, as Lancaster says, built a new one
for he deeded the existing structure with the supporting land to his
son Stevens Thomson Mason, confirming the grant in his will, together
with the plate and furniture then in the dwelling; which
indicates a more impressive home than the first building.</p>

<p>Thomson Mason died at Raspberry Plain on the 26th February,
1785, and was there buried; but the first mansion and burial place
were not where the imposing modern house of the same name now
stands but rather much to the north, near the fine spring and branch
for a long time included in the present Selma lands, for the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
estate was, of course, at that time and long afterward but another
part of the extensive Mason holdings. It is of interest to note that
this original Raspberry Plain holding was never acquired by Francis
Aubrey nor was it part of Mrs. Ann Thomson Mason's purchase.
On the contrary, it comprised a small grant, stated to be 322 acres,
made by the Proprietor to one Joseph Dixon, a blacksmith, by patent
dated the 2nd July, 1731.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Dixon, in turn, sold it to Aeneas Campbell
by deed dated the 15th July, 1754, for a consideration nominally
stated as "five shillings"&mdash;the old-time equivalent of our "One Dollar
and other good and valuable considerations"&mdash;and Campbell
was living there when commissioned the first sheriff of Loudoun in
1757. In the deed to him the plantation is described as being "On
the branches of Limestone run called and known by the name of
raspberry plain" and the grant goes on to give the exact location by
metes and bounds. It apparently had been more carefully surveyed
and found to have more area than first believed, for it is further described
as containing "393 acres as appears by a survey thereof" and
the grant specifically includes "all houses, buildings, orchards, ways,
waters, water-courses," etc. Therefore Dixon may be credited with
having built the first Raspberry Plain house, a matter long in doubt
locally.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> The estate was subsequently sold by Campbell and Lydia
his wife to Thomson Mason, by deed dated the 15th day of May,
1760, for 500 pounds current money of Virginia.</p>

<p>Around 1750 there came from Scotland to this same country,
north of the present Leesburg, that William Douglass who is to be
so frequently mentioned by Nicholas Cresswell in his journal at the
time of the Revolution. Colonel Douglass, as he afterward became,
was the son of Hugh Douglass of Garalland in Ayshire who, in turn,
was sixth in descent from the Earl of Douglas and also a descendant
of the Campbell Barons of Loudoun, thus making the Douglass
family of Loudoun County kinsfolk to the Earl of Loudoun for
whom the county was to be named. Our William Douglass owned
the estates of Garalland and Montressor in Loudoun, served as one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
her justices (1770) and as sheriff in 1782. He died in the latter year,
leaving a will which was probated on the 24th September 1782.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>In the meanwhile the settlement of the Quakers was increasing
rapidly in population. As early as 1736, it is said, Hannah Janney,
the wife of Jacob Janney, held the services of her sect twice a week
on a tree-stump in the forest "and on that spot a log house was built
in 1751 and a meeting established" which was and still is known
as the Goose Creek meeting. This log hut in 1765 was superseded
by a stone building and as the congregation grew and the latter
building was found too small, it was replaced, in 1817, by a brick
meeting-house; but the old stone building of 1765 still stands and is
owned by the Friends. Remodelled as a dwelling house it is now
occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence Taylor.</p>

<p>A monument today marks the place, now in the village of Lincoln,
where the good Hannah Janney worshipped. It stands in a
grove of trees and reads:</p>

<p>"Here on a log in the unbroken forest Hannah Janney, wife of
Jacob Janney, worshipped twice weekly in 1736. In 1738 Friends
meetings were held in a private house once a month. Then a log
meeting house. Then the old stone house in 1765 and the brick
house in 1817."</p>

<p>By 1743 or 1744 the Friends had erected a church, known as
the Fairfax Meeting, at Waterford, where as we have seen in a prior
chapter (V), they soon had become very numerous and through
their energy and thrift had really established that little settlement's
early character and prosperity. This first meeting house of the
Friends followed the fate which appeared to hover over so many of
Virginia's early structures; it duly disappeared in flames and in its
place in 1868 there was constructed the present substantial and
commodious edifice, now only too seldom used because of the
dwindling of the Quaker population there.</p>

<p>Concurrently another religious organization had been growing
rapidly in the colonies. The Baptists had experienced the well-proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
truth that religious persecution is a most fertile soil for religious
growth. "Magistrates and mobs, priests and Sheriffs, courts
and parsons all vainly combined to divert them from their object,"
writes one of their historians. The Baptists in Virginia are said to
have originated from three sources&mdash;emigrants in 1714, directly
from England, settling in the southeasterly part of the Colony,
others from Maryland about 1743 going to the northwesterly part,
and still another group leaving New England about 1754 and going
to what is now Berkely County in West Virginia. Between 1750
and 1755 John Gerrard, a Baptist preacher of Maryland, is said to
have gone to Berkely County and thence journeyed over the Blue
Ridge into the present Loudoun "where he found the people ready
to listen to the proclamation of the gospel." The first Baptist church
in Loudoun (and perhaps in Virginia as well) was built at Ketocton
in 1756 or 1757, according to tradition, to be followed by a stone
building in 1815 and then, in 1856, by the present brick edifice.</p>

<p>Until 1765 the Baptist congregations in Virginia were united to
the Philadelphia Association but in that year obtained their dismissal
and set about the task of building their own association in Virginia.
Their first convention was held "in Ketocton in Loudoun" the
old church there thus giving the first Baptist Association in Virginia
its name. At that time the Colony had only four Baptist churches
but all of them were represented at this first convention by the following
delegates</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ketocton: John Marks and John Loyd.</span><br />

<p>A resolution was adopted to seek from the parent association in
Philadelphia instructions for the guidance of the new organization.
As their association grew in membership, it "was divided into two in
1789 by a line running from the Potomac a south course." The
westerly portion retained the Ketocton name and that to the east was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
known as the Chappawamsick. This division continued until 1792
when the districts were again united.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>It is believed that a congregation of the German Reformed Church
at Lovettsville was organized before 1747 and possibly at once on the
arrival of the first German settlers in the Lovettsville neighbourhood,
about 1731. Again we are faced with the loss or destruction
of early records; but the Rev. Michael Schlatter, one of the early
founders of the Reformed Church in America, kept a journal from
which it appears that he preached to a Reformed congregation in our
German Settlement at the home of Elder William Wenner in the
month of May, 1747. It is believed that there was, at a very early
day, a building of logs used as a church and as a schoolhouse as well
and that this continued to serve its congregation until 1810, when a
larger brick building was erected which gave way in 1901 to another
structure.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>By patent dated the 7th day of December, 1731, Rawleigh Chinn
of Lancaster County acquired from Lord Fairfax 3,300 acres near
Goose Creek and adjacent to a huge patent of 13,879 acres lying
along the east side of Goose Creek which already had been granted
to Colonel Charles Burgess, also of Lancaster. This grant to Chinn
was on the Proprietor's usual terms, reserving to the latter "yearly
and every year on the feast day of Saint Michael the Archangel the
fee rent of one shilling sterling money for every fifty acres of Land
hereby granted and so for a greater or lesser quantity"; and also
meticulously reciting, "Royal mines excepted and a full third part
of all lead, copper, tin, coals, iron mines and iron ore that shall be
found thereon." Raleigh Chinn had married Esther, a daughter of
Colonel Joseph Ball of Epping Forest, Lancaster County, an older
sister of Mary Ball who was to marry Augustine Washington; and
he, although never living on his purchase of forest lands in the "upper
country," appears to have been so well pleased with his investment
that he subsequently added heavily thereto; so that at the time
of his death in August, 1741, he left to his children a large estate in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
what later became Loudoun and Fauquier Counties. One of Raleigh
Chinn's sons, Joseph, in January, 1763, sold to Leven Powell 500
acres of his inheritance and on a part of this land Colonel Powell
later (1782) laid out the town of Middleburg. Thomas Chinn, a
brother of Joseph, lived on the land on Goose Creek he had inherited
from his father and according to family tradition, employed his
young cousin, George Washington, to survey it for him, Washington
occupying "an office on a beautiful hill," built for him by Chinn.
Another surveyor who had run out the Chinn lines was Colonel
Thomas Marshall who was the first county surveyor of Fauquier,
subsequently became its burgess and sheriff, played a most gallant
part in the Revolution and became the father of the famous Chief
Justice.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>Leven Powell, at the time of his purchase from Joseph Chinn,
was no stranger to Loudoun, for his father, William Powell, had acquired
land in the neighbourhood of the present Middleburg as
early as 1741. Although these lands had been repeatedly surveyed
from the time of the original patents to Raleigh Chinn, Charles
Burgess and others, in a day when forest surveys customarily ran to
a red or white oak, an ash or a walnut tree, it may be supposed that
boundary lines, in spite of "processioning," not infrequently became
the subject of vigourous dispute; so in the Middleburg neighbourhood
the Chinn and Powell heirs fell out, in 1811, over their dividing
lines and the accuracy of the survey made in 1731 by John
Barber for Charles Burgess, William Stamp, Thomas Thornton and
Rawleigh Chinn the burgess. About 500 acres of arable land and
500 acres of forest were involved and hot was the legal warfare and
very numerous the depositions from distant witnesses in Virginia
and Kentucky obtained and filed in Loudoun's Superior Court. At
the end, the litigation appears to have resolved itself into some sort
of compromise; for on the 7th April, 1814, we find the Superior
Court ordering "this Day came the Parties by their Attorneys and
this suit is discontinued being agreed between the Parties."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
memory of their warfare still ruffled the litigants' minds; for upon
the settlement being effected, "Sailor" Rawleigh Chinn, grandson
and namesake of the patentee, proceeded to build upon the land
set off to him "Mount Recovery" which, burned in the Civil War,
was afterwards rebuilt and became the home of Mr. Thomas Dudley,
subsequently being sold to Mr. Oliver Iselin; while Burr Powell,
the other litigant, built on the tract set off to him a house he called
Mount Defiance which in later years was owned by the Thatcher
and Bishop families.</p>

<p>In 1744 John Hough, according to family tradition, settled in
these Fairfax backwoods "and served for many years as surveyor for
the vast estate of Lord Fairfax." He became the progenitor of the
family which has become numerous in Loudoun and includes Emerson
Hough, well known American novelist, though the latter was
born in Iowa.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> His surveys were much needed, for by 1750 the pressure
of settlers for grants in these uplands had so increased that "Lord
Fairfax's land office was crowded with applicants" we are told.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

</div>


<p>We have come to the outbreak of that great world
conflict between England and Prussia on the one side
against France and Austria, Russia, Sweden, and Saxony
on the other which Fiske, writing before the devastation of 1914,
called the most memorable war of modern times and which, involving
three continents, ultimately passed the vast French territories
in Canada and India to the British crown. In European history
the contest is known, somewhat inadequately, as the Seven Years
War and gave Frederick the Great of Prussia the fateful opportunity
to demonstrate his extraordinary military genius; but in America it
is known as the French and Indian War from the terrible alliance
that the English colonists were forced there to face.</p>

<p>The menace of the French control of Canada had never oppressed
the imagination of Virginia as it had that of New England and
New York. Distance and lack of colonial unity tended to build
in the minds of the Virginia Assembly the belief that it was a matter,
to the Old Dominion at least, of secondary interest; though her
royal governors, and especially Dinwiddie, recognized its true and
pressing danger. Virginia claimed jurisdiction over a vast and largely
unknown western territory, including much of what is now western
Pennsylvania and that strategic point marking the confluence of the
Alleghany and Monongahela rivers, now covered by the city of Pittsburgh.
The French in Canada were well aware of the huge military
importance of this "gateway of the west" and, although at the time
peace was supposed to exist between England and France, in 1753
sent a small expedition south to take possession of it. News of these
Frenchmen in Virginia territory came to Governor Dinwiddie who,
in turn, sent the twenty-one year old Washington, already a major in
the militia of Virginia, to remonstrate and protest to their commander.
On his journey Washington travelled the road to Vestal's
Gap and crossed the Blue Ridge at that point. Though he faithfully
delivered his message, the English protest was ignored, the French
commander asserting that all that domain belonged to his King and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
that the English had no territorial rights west of the mountains.
Thereupon the energetic Dinwiddie decided that war or no war the
French should be dislodged. A regiment of 300 Virginians was
organized under Colonel Joshua Fry, with Major Washington as
second in command, to take possession of the disputed "gateway"
and fortify it.</p>

<p>This expedition, too, followed the road to Vestal's Gap and
Washington, as was his habit, kept a journal of his experience. By
the mischance of events this journal was to be captured later by the
French at Fort Necessity; but in 1756, to bolster their claim that
this English expedition was an unprovoked attack against a friendly
power in time of peace, they published in French so much of it as
served their purpose. Unfortunately the published portion did not
include the march through Piedmont; but in Washington's accounting
with the Virginia government we find these items:</p>

<p>
"1754<br />
"Apl. 6 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To expences of the Regim<sup>t</sup> at Edward<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Thompson's in marching up&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2&#8243; 16.0</span><br />

</p>

<p>Edward Thompson was a Quaker who lived near the present Hillsboro
and who was to leave numerous descendants in Loudoun.</p>

<p>From the Shenandoah the little force pressed on into Western
Maryland where at Will's Creek (the present Cumberland) then
a trading station of the Ohio Company, 140 miles west from their
objective, Colonel Fry was stricken with an illness which, a short
time later, was to prove fatal. Leaving their colonel behind, the Virginia
militia, now under the command of Major Washington, advanced
very slowly cutting a narrow road through the forest and
sending a small force ahead to begin work on the proposed fort at
the confluence of the rivers. That work was hardly begun, however,
when a greatly superior force of French and Indians, arriving suddenly
on the scene from the north, drove the Virginians away, took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
possession of the place and continued the fort's construction naming
it, on completion, Fort DuQuesne after Canada's French Governor.</p>

<p>The retreating Virginians fell back through the woods until they
joined Washington's main force, encamped at Great Meadows, and
it was not long before Washington learned from his Indian scouts
that a small party of enemy skirmishers was cautiously advancing to
deliver a surprise attack. Washington promptly determined on a
counter-surprise with such complete success that the Virginians
killed Jumonville, the French leader, and nine of his followers and
captured the remaining twenty-two. But Washington knew that a
much larger force of French would soon attack him and that his position
was precarious. With earthworks and logs he caused his men
to hastily fortify their camp, grimly called by him Fort Necessity.
They had not long to wait for the enemy. There soon emerged from
the surrounding forest a force of six hundred French and Indians
from Fort DuQuesne who, apparently not finding that the appearance
of the fort or the reputation of its defenders invited an attack,
settled down to a siege. Washington, though in the meanwhile reinforced,
had not more than three hundred Virginians and about one
hundred and fifty Indian auxiliaries; but more serious than his inequality
of numbers were his rapidly dwindling supplies of food and
ammunition. This was the situation which resulted in Washington's
first and last surrender during his long military career. The French so
little relished an attack on the fort or a longer siege that the English
were allowed to march out and begin their retreat (4th of July, 1754)
under arms and with full honors of war.</p>

<p>All of this began to look very much like a fresh outbreak of war
between England and France; but more and worse was to follow before
a formal declaration of war was made in 1756. The Duke of
Cumberland, son of George II, then Captain General of the British
Armies, laid plans for a great American campaign which, once for
all, was to cripple the French power in the west. Three expeditions
were devised against French strategic strongholds on the American
continent: One was to proceed against Crown Point on Lake George,
a second against Fort Niagara and the third to capture the newly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
erected Fort DuQuesne. Major-General Edward Braddock, a veteran
soldier thoroughly trained on Europe's battlefields, of unquestioned
personal courage but abysmally ignorant of Indian warfare, was
vested with the supreme command and with two British regiments,
the 44th and 48th, set sail for America. The expedition landed at
Alexandria where a general conference was immediately called at
which were present, in addition to Braddock, Governor Dinwiddie
of Virginia, Governor Delancey and Colonel William Johnson of
New York, Governor Shirley of Massachusetts, Governor Sharp of
Maryland, Governor Morris of Pennsylvania and other leaders. To
these men Braddock revealed his orders and plans and the governors
received the King's instructions as to the part they were to play in
the campaign.</p>

<p>Alexandria was a poor starting point for Fort DuQuesne. Far better
would have been Philadelphia, offering as it did not only a
shorter route but more abundant and easily available supplies. Maryland
interests, seeking the advantage of the highway to the west
which the army would make, brought pressure to bear to have the
force go through that Colony. It was finally decided to send a part
of the troops through Maryland and a part through Virginia, the
divided army to come together again at Will's Creek where, in the
meanwhile, a large and strongly palisaded fort had been built by
Colonel James Innes under the instructions of Governor Dinwiddie.
A force of 1,400 Virginians and Marylanders was raised and added
to the English troops and "on the 8th and 9th of April the provincials
and six companies of the 44th under command of Sir Peter
Halkett set out for Winchester, Lieutenant Colonel Gage and four
companies remaining to escort the artillery. On the 18th of April the
48th, under Colonel Dunbar, set out for Frederick."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Although
General Braddock, with Major Washington on his staff, crossed over
into Maryland at Rock Creek and went to Will's Creek through
that Colony, never entering or even seeing the embryo Loudoun,
the local stories are still repeated, and with the utmost confidence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of the route he followed through that County and even where he
spent the night. It was, as it still is, "Braddock's Army" in popular
parlance and, as time passed, the commander's presence with the
march through Virginia became a part of its story.</p>

<p>Had the supreme command of the expedition been vested in
Halkett, rather than Braddock, one may reasonably believe that
there would have been a very different outcome. A trained and able
soldier, no less courageous than his chief, he was more cautious,
more susceptible to new ideas and methods and far less arbitrary
than lay in Braddock's nature to be. He learned to respect the dearly
bought and superior knowledge of Indian fighting traits possessed
by the provincials and wished to follow their recommendations that
to Braddock, with his unbounded confidence in iron discipline,
simply savoured of colonial ignorance and lack of military courage.
Loudoun should remember Halkett not only as the commander of
the march through her domain but as a brave and devoted soldier as
well.</p>

<p>"Sir Peter Halkett of Pitferran, Fifeshire, a baronet of Nova
Scotia," writes Sargent, "was the son of Sir Peter Wedderburne of
Gosford, who, marrying the heiress of the ancient family of Halkett,
assumed her name."<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Our Sir Peter had married Lady Amelia Stewart,
second daughter of Francis, 8th Earl of Moray, by whom he had
three sons. Of these, James, the youngest, was a subaltern in his
father's regiment and accompanied him on the expedition.</p>

<p>Of the Virginia troops serving in this campaign an effort has been
made to identify such as came from the incipient Loudoun. All the
Virginians were directly under the command of Captain Waggoner.
As Loudoun was then a part of Fairfax her men were, of course,
listed as from the latter county.</p>

<p>In March, 1756, the Virginia Legislature passed as its first act<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> an
emergency measure from which we learn the names of certain soldiers
from the then undivided Fairfax but from which side of Difficult
Run each man came does not appear, or as to whether they went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
on Braddock's expedition or served nearer home, then or subsequently.
The small amount of compensation awarded to each indicates
a period of active service too short to have permitted them to be
at the battle. Probably they were used east of the Blue Ridge.</p>

<p>That not all of the Virginia soldiers of the expedition of 1755
were enthusiastic volunteers is suggested by the passage of Chapter
II of the session of 1754 which states in its preamble that as the King
had instructed his lieutenant governor to raise soldiers for the expedition
against the French on the Ohio and that there were "in every
county and corporation within this Colony, able bodied persons, fit
to serve his majesty, and who follow no lawful calling or employment"
the justices of the peace, through the sheriffs, were ordered to
forcibly enlist them, provided they were not voters or indentured
servants!<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> To raise money for the campaign an act was passed in
May, 1755, instituting a public lottery with a first prize of £2,000
"current money" and many other prizes amounting altogether to
£20,000 "current money."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>The route to be followed by Halkett's command is given in Braddock's
Orderly Book as follows:</p>

<p>Thus from the date of entry, only two days after the last of Halkett's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
men had left the camp, we learn that the route given was the
one ordered followed, rather than a report of one that had been pursued;
but as it carefully describes the main northern road from Alexandria
to Winchester it is safe to assume that the troops held to the
course laid down for them.</p>

<p>The "Old Court House" was the first courthouse of Fairfax
County built about 1742 and in use about ten years until another
was built in Alexandria. Thus at the time of the march it was no
longer used for the purpose for which it had been built. It stood near
the present Tyson's Corner and in recent years its site has been
marked by an appropriate inscription.</p>

<p>The "Mr. Colemans on Sugar Land Run" was the house of Richard
Coleman who was thereafter in 1756 licensed by the Fairfax
Court to keep an Ordinary there. It stood where the road then
crossed Sugarland Run at the mouth of Colvin Run.</p>

<p>The "Mr. Miners" was the plantation of Nicholas Minor who
served as a captain in this war and who soon was to lay out the town
of Leesburg on part of his estate. It was known as Fruitland and the
residence was situated on a knoll on the south side of the road about
a mile east of the present Leesburg where a later building but bearing
the same name now stands. There Miner in connection with his
other activities, operated a distillery, probably for making brandy
from peaches, apples and persimmons; according to General John
Mason, a son of the famous George of Gunston Hall "the art of distilling
from grain was not then among us" and he spoke of the time
of his boyhood&mdash;a period well after 1755. A later writer comments:
"The choice of such camping places as this perhaps explains
in some measure the frequent court-martials in the army and the
liberal rewards of from 600 to 1,000 lashes to recreant soldiers for
drunkenness and for giving liquor to the Indians who accompanied
the march or whom they met on the way."<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> There is much evidence
that the British regulars, who had been recently recruited, frequently
were disciplined for infraction of military rules and the disciplinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
measures employed in British armies of that day were not gentle.</p>

<p>The "Mr. Thompson ye Quaker" we have already met in the
preceding year when Washington, in Fry's expedition against the
French at the "Gateway," noted his "expences." He lived, it will be
recalled, in the locality which is now Hillsboro.</p>

<p>The "Mr. They's ye Ferry at Shanh" was, it is believed, in error
for "Mr. Key's" and was at the Key's Gap Ferry.</p>

<p>All of this gives very little local detail. Fortunately that is more
freely supplied from another and fortuitous source. There was attached
to Braddock's expedition, when it left England, a certain
commissary who had a widowed sister, one Mrs. Browne. She accompanied
her brother from London to Fort Cumberland and, following
the valuable eighteenth century habit, kept a journal which
in 1924 was owned by Mr. S. A. Courtauld of the Howe, Halstead,
Essex, and a photostatic copy of which has been acquired by the
Library of Congress.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> This journal or diary runs from the 17th November,
1754, to the 19th January, 1757. When Braddock and his
men departed from Alexandria in April he had a number of soldiers
too ill to travel. These he left there temporarily in charge of a force of
"1 officer and 40 men" and the commissary (Mrs. Browne's
brother), and Mrs. Browne stayed with them to help nurse the invalids.
By June the sick men had so far recovered that they moved to
join the main force, following the old Ridge (Alexandria-Winchester)
Road over which Halkett and his men had marched before
them. Here follows a full copy of Mrs. Browne's journal entries
from her entrance into present Loudoun until she reached the Shenandoah:</p>

<p>1755. "June the 2. At Break of Day the Drum beat. I was extreemly
sleepy but got up, and as soon as our Officer had eat 6 Eggs
and drank a dram or two and some Punch we march'd; but, my
Waggon being in the Rear the Day before, my Coachman insisted
that it was not right that Madam Browne should be behind, and if
they did not give way they should feel the soft end of his Whip. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
gain'd his Point and got in Front. The Roads are so Bad that I am
almost disjointed. At 12 we halted at Mr. Coleman's, pitched our
markeys and dined on Salt Gammon,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> nothing better to be had.</p>

<p>"June the 3. At 3 in the Morning was awak'd by the Drum, but
was so stiff that I was at a loss to tell whether I had any Limbs. I
breakfasted in my waggon and then sent of in front; at which all
the rest were very much enrag'd, but to no Purpose for my Coachman
told them that he had but one Officer to Obey and she was in
his Waggon, and it was not right she should be blinded with Dust.
My Brother the Day before left his Cloak behind, so sent his Man
back for it on his Horse, and march'd on Foot. On the Road met with
Mr. Adams a Parson<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> who left his Horse &amp; padded with them on
Foot. We halted at Mr. Minors. We order'd some Fowls for Dinner
but not one to be had, so was obliged to set down to our old Dish
Gammon &amp; Greens. The Officer and the Parson replenish'd their
Bowl so often that they began to be very joyous, untill their Servant
told them that their Horses were lost, at which the Parson was much
inrag'd and pop'd out an Oath but Mr. Falkner said 'Never mind
your Horse, Doctor, but have you a Sermon ready for next Sunday?'
I being the Doctor's country woman he mad me many Compts. and
told me he should be very happy if he could be better acquainted
with me, but hop'd when I came that way again I would do him the
Honour to spend some Time at his House. I chatted til 11 and then
took my leave and left them a full Bowl before them.</p>

<p>"June the 4. At break of Day my Coachman came and tap'd my
Chamber Door and said Madam all is ready and it is right early. I
went to my Waggon and we moved on. Left Mr. Falkner behind
in Pursuit of his Horse. March'd 14 Miles and halted at an old sage
Quaker's with silver Locks. His Wife on my coming in accosted me
in the following manner: 'Welcome Friend set down, thou seem's
full Bulky to travel, but thou art young and that will enable thee. We
were once so ourselves but we have been married 44 Years &amp; may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
say we have lived to see the Days that we have no Pleasure therein.'
We had recourse to our old Dish Gammon, nothing else to be had;
but they said they had some Liquor they called Whiskey which was
made of Peaches. My Friend Thompson being a Preacher, when the
soldiers came in as the Spirit mov'd him, held forth to them and told
them the great Virtue of Temperance. They all stared at him like
Pigs, but had not a word to say in their justification.</p>

<p>"June the 5. My Lodgings not being very clean, I had so many
close Companions call'd Ticks that deprived me of my Night's
Rest, but I indulg'd till 7. We halted this Day all the Nurses Baking
Bread and Boiling Beef for the March to Morrow. A fine Regale 2
Chickens with Milk and water to Drink, which my friend Thompson
said was fine temperate Liquor. Several things lost out of my
Waggon, amongst the rest they took 2 of my Hams, which my
Coachman said was an abomination to him, and if he could find out
who took them he would make them remember taking the next.</p>

<p>"June the 6. Took my leave of my Friend Thompson, who bid me
farewell. A great Gust of Thunder and Lightning and Rain, so that
we were almost drown'd. Extreem bad Roads. We pass'd over the
Blue Ridge which was one continual mountain for 3 miles. Forg'd
through 2 Rivers. At 7 we halted at Mr. Key's, a fine Plantation.
Had for Dinner 2 Chickens. The Soldiers desired my Brother to advance
them some Whisky for they told him he had better kill them
at once than to let them dye by Inches, for without they could not
live. He complied with their Request and it soon began to operate;
they all went to dancing and bid defiance to the French. My Friend
Gore" (the coachman) "began to shake a Leg. I ask'd him if it was
consistent as a member of his Society to dance; he told me that he was
not at all united with them, and that there were some of his People
who call'd themselves Quakers and stood up for their Church but
had no more religion in them than his Mare. I told him I should set
him down as a Ranter."</p>

<p>But to return to Halkett and the troops under his immediate command.
From Winchester they proceeded to the new fort at Will's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Creek which Braddock, upon his arrival, named Fort Cumberland in
honour of his captain general. Here the main detachments of the
expedition came together again in accordance with the plans made
in Alexandria. The troops were given a short rest after their long
march, the final plans were developed and on the 7th, 8th and 9th of
June the army resumed its march to the west, widening the path
through the woods made by Washington and his men the year before
and hauling its artillery over the mountains with the utmost difficulty.
So slow was their progress that Braddock decided to send on a
large advance party, more lightly equipped, leaving the others to
bring on the greater part of the supplies and baggage.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Fall of Braddock.</span> (From a painting by C. Schuessele, published in 1859.)</span>
</div>

<p>In contrast to Braddock's unbounded assurance, Halkett seems to
have had a strong premonition of the impending disaster and his
own tragic fate. Lowdermilk, in his excellent <i>History of Cumberland</i>,
describes his dejection the night before the battle:</p>

<p>"Sir Peter Halkett was low spirited and depressed; he comprehended
the importance of meeting the wily red skins with their own
tactics, and while he urged the General to beat the bushes over every
foot of ground from the camp to the Fort, he had little hope of seeing
his advice put into effect; when he wrapped his mantle about him
that night as he lay upon his soldier's bed his soul was filled with the
darkest forebodings for the morrow, which he felt would close his
own career as well as that of many another gallant soldier, a presentiment
which was sadly realized."</p>

<p>Upon the following day, the 9th of July, the advance party of
British, now making better progress, pressed on to a point five or six
miles from Fort DuQuesne where they encountered the awaiting
French and Indians. Against such British strength of numbers and
equipment the French had one chance and well they knew it lay in
meeting the attacking force in the forest before it could bring its artillery
to play on their fortification. The mass of the scarlet-coated
British troops were in close formation in the open; the French and
Indians hid themselves behind the surrounding trees. As the first
bullets poured into their ranks the British could see no foe and Braddock,
deaf to the entreaties of the Virginians, insisted that his troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
hold their ranks in the unprotected and open clearing. The provincials
scattered and fought the foe in its own manner from behind
every tree and mound they could find to shelter them; but Braddock,
wholly immune to fear or reason himself, continued to hold his
regulars together, in his anger beating back with his sword into the
ranks those seeking cover. Even so the situation, impossible though
it were rapidly becoming, might have been saved by the desperate
and determined efforts of the provincials who had found a small ravine
or ditch from which they were able to deliver an effective flanking
fire against the French; but as the latter began to waver and the
Americans left their protection to charge, the panic-stricken regulars
fired upon them, killing and wounding a great number. It was
the end. Braddock, who throughout the fighting had shewn the
most reckless and obstinate courage and had had his horses killed
from under him again and again, now received a mortal wound and
the surviving English broke into a wild and disorderly retreat. Had
the French and their allies pressed their advantage, hardly one of
their foe would have escaped death or capture; but the Indian allies
of the French, when the British fled, addressed themselves to killing
the wounded and robbing and scalping the dead, thus giving the
English their chance of flight, disorderly and panic-stricken, back
over the road they had come. Braddock, crushed with the completeness
of his defeat, died on the fourth day of the retreat and was
buried in the roadway to protect his body from the Indian savages.
How overwhelming was the French victory is shewn by the English
record that of the 1,386 men who were under Braddock in the fight,
only 459 escaped. That the British regulars stood their ground
bravely in the face of most difficult conditions and stupid leadership
there seems no question. But the greater praise went to the Americans
who inflicted far more damage on the foe; and particularly to
their leader Washington who with cool courage was everywhere encouraging
his men in the fight and though his clothing was pierced
repeatedly with rifle balls, he escaped wholly unwounded.</p>

<p>During the battle Halkett was shot and killed and his son James,
seeing him fall and rushing to his aid, at once met the same fate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Both bodies were scalped and robbed and then left where they fell.
Three years later Halkett's eldest son, the then Sir Peter Halkett, a
major in the 42nd Regiment, joined General Forbes' new and successful
expedition against Fort DuQuesne, especially to seek some trace
of the fate of his father and brother. With friendly Indian help the
bodies were found and identified and given a military burial nearby.</p>

<p>As the defeated English retreated to the east, the story of the
calamity spread terror and dismay among the more westerly settlers.
In Virginia the people in the valley were panic-stricken and in great
numbers fled over the Blue Ridge to the Piedmont counties, spreading
their terror among the people there. Washington wrote that he
learned from Captain Waggoner who, as we have seen, had had
command of the Virginia troops and had been wounded in the battle
"that it was with difficulty he passed the Ridge for crowds of people,
who were flying as if every moment was death." The fear and restlessness
continued among the colonists on both sides of the Blue
Ridge until General Forbes, as noted, in 1758 led his force to Fort
DuQuesne and took possession of what was left by the French who
burned and abandoned it at his approach. From then until after the
Revolution this former outpost of France, under its new name of
Fort Pitt, remained in the hands of the English government.</p>

<p>On the 1st day of September, 1758,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> an act was passed in Virginia
to pay arrears to "forces in the pay of this colony" and to raise money
therefor. Section 5 recites:</p>

<p>"And whereas several companies of the militia were lately drawn
out into actual service, for the defense and protection of the frontiers

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>ORGANIZATION OF LOUDOUN AND THE FOUNDING
OF LEESBURG</h3>


<p>In the Virginia of England's rule, the vestry of a Parish "divided
with the County Court the responsibility of local government,
having as their especial charge the maintenance of religion
and the oversight of all things pertaining thereto in the domain
of charity and morals."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> The parish was a territorial subdivision with
large civil as well as ecclesiastical powers and duties and when,
through increasing population, a parish came to be divided, in those
days of expanding settlement, it usually was followed by the creation
of a new county. As has been noted in a prior chapter, Truro
Parish, then coextensive with Fairfax County, was divided in 1748
by the Assembly setting off the upper part thereof, above Difficult
Run, as Cameron Parish, thus indicating the early organization of
a new county. But the politicians of Tidewater were beginning to
look askance at the rapid increase of new counties in the upper country,
fearing a diminution of their influence and control and perhaps
there was some opposition in Fairfax itself. A petition presented to
the Assembly in 1754 by the people of Cameron that they be
formed into a new county resulted in a bill being passed to that end
which, however, was disapproved by the Council. Again a petition
was presented to the next Assembly with no better success; but on
the 8th day of June, 1757 a bill was passed creating the new county.
It reads as follows:</p>

<p>"An Act for Dividing the County of Fairfax</p>

<p>"I. Whereas many inconveniences attend the upper inhabitants
of the County of Fairfax by reason of the large extent of said county,
and their remote situation from the court house, and the said inhabitants
have petitioned this present general assembly that the said
county be divided: Be it, therefore enacted, by the Lieutenant-Governor,
Council and Burgesses of this present General Assembly, and
it is hereby enacted, by the authority of the same, that from and
after the 1st day of July next ensuing the said county of Fairfax be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
divided into two counties, that is to say: All that part thereof, lying
above Difficult run, which falls into the Patowmack river, and by a
line to be run from the head of the same run, a straight course, to
the mouth of Rocky run, shall be one distinct county, and called and
known by the name of Loudoun: And all that part below the said
run and course, shall be another distinct county, and retain the name
of Fairfax.</p>

<p>"II. And for the due administration of justice in the said county
of Loudoun, after the same shall take place: Be it further enacted by
the authority aforesaid, that after the first day of July a court for
the said county of Loudoun be constantly held by the justices thereof,
upon the second Tuesday in every month in such manner as by
the laws of this colony is provided, and shall be by their commission
directed.</p>

<p>"III. Provided always, that nothing herein contained shall be
constructed to hinder the sheriff or collector of the said county of
Fairfax, as the same now stands entire and undivided, from collecting
and making distress for any public dues, or officers fees, which shall
remain unpaid by the inhabitants of said county of Loudoun at the
time of its taking place; but such sheriff or collector shall have the
same power to collect or distrain for such dues and fees, and shall
be answerable for them in the same manner as if this act had never
been made, any law, usage or custom to the contrary thereof in any
wise notwithstanding.</p>

<p>"IV. And be it further enacted, by the authority aforesaid, that
the court of the said county of Fairfax shall have jurisdiction of all
actions and suits, both in law and equity, which shall be depending
before them at the time the said division shall take place; and shall
and may try and determine all such actions and suits, and issue process
and award execution in any such action or suit in the same manner
as if this act had never been made, any law, usage, or custom to
the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.</p>

<p>"V. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that
out of every hundred pounds of tobacco, paid in discharge of quit
rents, secretary's, clerk's, sheriff's, surveyor's, or other officers fees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and so proportionately for a greater or lesser quantity, there shall be
made the following abatements or allowances to the payer, that is to
say: For tobacco due in the county of Fairfax ten pounds of tobacco,
and for tobacco due in the county of Loudoun twenty pounds of tobacco;
and that so much of the act of the assembly, intitled, An Act
for amending the staple of tobacco, and preventing frauds in his
Majesty's customs, as relates to anything within the purview of this
act, shall be and is hereby repealed and made void."<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>The boundaries of the new county thus fixed have since that time
been changed but once, when in 1798, a part of the originally constituted
Loudoun was, by act of the Legislature, returned to Fairfax as
later will be noted.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>Thus, from the formation of Northumberland County in 1647,
it had taken 110 years for a sufficient population to penetrate, settle
and develop in the backwoods to justify the organization of Loudoun.
At first the creation of new counties out of the early Northumberland
had been rapid. Lancaster along the Rappahannock was formed
in 1651 and Westmoreland along the Potomac in 1653. Out of
Westmoreland came Stafford in 1664. Then, so far as the line of
descent of Loudoun is concerned, there is a long wait. Indian warfare
and Indian domination of the upper country effectually held
back settlement until Spotswood's epochal treaty of 1722. With the
withdrawal of the Indians the pressure from Tidewater rapidly had
its effect. Out of the Stafford "backwoods" and those of King George
to the south was organized in 1731 Prince William with a disputed
western boundary, the Proprietor claiming much of the Shenandoah
Valley and the Virginia government holding to the Blue Ridge but
the act discretely leaving that question untouched. In 1742 the territory
above "Occoquan and Bull Run and from the head of the main
branch of Bull Run by a straight course" to Ashley's Gap became the
County of Fairfax of which, as shown, Loudoun in 1757 was born.
Her contiguous county Fauquier was, by contrast, taken directly
from Prince William in 1759.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>It would have been wholly appropriate to have named the new
county Lee or Carter, honoring families and individuals which had
been so active in its development but the Lees then loved the Carters
not at all nor the Carters the Lees and doubtlessly each would, and
perhaps did, prevent the honor going to the other. So it came about
that the lusty infant became the namesake of a man whose fame, so
far as Virginia and the other American Colonies were concerned,
was highly ephemeral. On the 17th February, 1756, in the winter
following Braddock's defeat, John Campbell, fourth Earl of Loudoun,
had been appointed Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief
of Virginia and, on the 20th of the month following, Commander-in-Chief
of the British forces in America. He seems to have owed his
selection to his own and his family's influence with Court and ministry;
certainly nothing in his earlier career had logically earned the bestowal
of a paramount command in such a critical period for Britain.
Loudoun, the only son of the third Earl of that ilk and his wife the
Lady Margaret Dalrymple (only daughter of John 1st Earl of Stair)
had been born in 1705 and succeeded his father in the title and
estates in 1731. From 1734, until his death in 1782, he was one of
the representative peers of Scotland. At the age of twenty-two he
entered the army and had been appointed Governor of Sterling
Castle in 1741, becoming aide-de-camp to the king in 1743. When
the Jacobite rebellion broke out in 1745 he had been a staunch supporter
of the House of Hanover, raising a regiment of Highlanders
of which he became colonel and which later was cut to pieces at the
Battle of Preston. Loudoun was one of the few who came out of the
fight unscathed and, shewing that upon occasion he was capable of
energy as well as loyalty, promptly he raised a force of more than two
thousand new soldiers.</p>

<p>When he arrived in New York on the 23rd July, 1756, he found
affairs in great confusion. After the care with which Braddock's campaign
had been planned for him and the disastrous outcome, the
home authorities were now slow to adopt measures to cope with the
crisis. Not only Fort DuQuesne but Forts Oswego and Ontario were
held by the French, aggressive and confident from their repeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
successes. After spending a year in surveying the situation, Loudoun
headed an expedition against Louisburg, going as far as Halifax and
then, though a caution made to appear the more excessive by inevitable
comparison with the dash and reckless courage of Pepperell's
earlier and sensationally successful expedition, returned to New York
without striking a blow. He had incurred great unpopularity earlier
in New York and now in Halifax although in the former, at least,
his measures of quartering troops and interference with commerce
fairly could be defended on the ground of military necessity. Of
more unfortunate importance, the ineptitude and dilatory inefficiency
of his Louisburg campaign had drained its defenders from the Hudson
Valley, thus permitting a successful and disastrous invasion of
the Province of New York by the French and their Indians and
Loudoun was peremptorily recalled to England (1757), General
Jeffrey Amherst being sent over to take his place. Loudoun's indecision
inspired Benjamin Franklin's famous epigram which all down
the years, to the few who remember Loudoun, remains inseparably
associated with his name: that, "he was like King George upon the
signposts, always on horseback but never advancing." There was,
however, at least one voice publicly raised on his behalf; an effort was
made in England to defend his conduct in America through an
anonymous pamphlet published in London the following year entitled
"The Conduct of a Noble Commander in America Impartially
Reviewed with the genuine Causes of the Discontents at New York
and Hallifax," one of the few surviving copies of which is now lodged
in the Library of Congress. And it was for this British general with
but a year of American experience (and that far from glorious) who
never, so far as it is known, set foot on Virginia's soil that the fairest
of Piedmont's counties was named during those brief months when
his ascendant star glowed with an all too temporary brilliance and
hope and expectation ran high. Had the county been organized
when first proposed or had its formation been further postponed, it
is a fair presumption that another name would have been chosen.</p>

<p>Lord Loudoun's American record seemingly did not end his influence
in London. In 1762, when war broke out between England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and Spain, he was appointed second in command, under Lord Tyrawley,
of the British troops sent to Portugal. As he never married,
his title upon his death at Loudoun Castle on the 27th April, 1782,
passed to his cousin, James Mure Campbell, a grandson of the
second Earl.</p>

<p>Of the first officials of Loudoun County, the following men by
commission of the Virginia Council, dated the 24th May, 1757, became
its first court or governing body: Anthony Russell, Fielding
Turner, James Hamilton, Aeneas Campbell, Nicholas Minor, William
West, of the Quorum, Richard Coleman, Josias Clapham,
George West, Charles Tyler, John Moss, Francis Peyton and John
Mucklehany. These men may be taken as outstanding residents.</p>

<p>We can learn from the early records something concerning the
actual procedure followed in organizing the new county. The first
entry in the volume of Court Orders is a record on the 12th day of
July, 1757, that a Commission of the Peace and Dedimus of the
county directed to the last mentioned "Gentlemen, justices of the
said County was produced and openly Read, and pursuant to the
Dedimus" that they took the oaths prescribed by law.</p>

<p>The first county clerk was Charles Binns who served thirty-nine
years in that capacity, from 1757 to 1796; to be succeeded by his
son Charles Binns, Jr., who, in his turn, served forty-one years or
from 1796 to 1837, a record indicating that Loudoun had been fortunate
in the selection for this office. It is traditional in the county that
the first clerk's office was at Rokeby, the present country seat of Mr.
and Mrs. B. Franklin Nalle.</p>

<p>The first sheriff was Aeneas Campbell who came to the then Fairfax
County from Saint Mary's County, Maryland, just in time to
become a lieutenant in that Fairfax company in the French War
captained by Nicholas Minor and whose home was at Raspberry
Plain as already has been shown.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> It is also locally related that the
first jail was a small brick building about twelve feet square, in his
yard there. A ducking-spring was also a part of the new sheriff's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
equipment at his home and was used to temper the enthusiasm of
females too greatly addicted to mischievous talking. A woman duly
convicted of idle gossip and slandering her neighbours, was generally
fined in tobacco; if the fine were not paid by her husband or the
dame herself, she was taken to the ducking-spring, where a long
pole had a chair with arms attached to its end. The talkative lady
was then tied in the chair, the pole lowered and she was immersed in
the pond a sufficient number of times to cause her ruefully to remember
her experience and, let us hope, amend her conduct. Alas! Alas!
<i>Tempora mutantur</i>.</p>

<p>Campbell's bond as sheriff occupies the place of honor in the first
Deed Book of the county on page one. He and his two sureties,
Anthony Russell and James Hamilton, bind themselves "unto our
Sovereign Lord King George the second in the sum of one thousand
pounds Current Money to be paid to our said Lord the King his
Heirs and Successors." Tobacco as money was all well enough in
Virginia but apparently was not appreciated by Royalty across the
sea.</p>

<p>Both county clerk and sheriff qualified at this first session of the
Court.</p>

<p>Aeneas Campbell was one of the leading spirits in the new county.
Not only was he its first sheriff but he built its first courthouse, as
later noted, and was an original trustee of Leesburg when that town
was "erected." In those days the outstanding men in a community
were chosen for public office and the frequency of his name on the
records unquestionably confirms his influential prominence. His
later career was interesting. After he sold Raspberry Plain to Thomson
Mason in 1760, we find him, in 1776, back in Maryland and
busily engaged in the work of the Revolution. He became captain of
the First Maryland Battalion of the Flying Camp in July of that year
and on the 18th of the month in Frederick County, is credited with
presenting to that command thirty-two men, including his son
Aeneas Campbell, Jr., (who held the rank of cadet) all of whom
were then reviewed and passed (accepted?) by Major John Fulford.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
His descendants, including the Giddings family of Leesburg,
proudly retain the tradition that Campbell raised and accoutred
this force entirely at his own expense, setting an example of patriotism
which Loudoun should remember.</p>

<p>The county lieutenant, first officer in rank but, in the present instance,
the last to be chosen, was not commissioned until December,
1757, when Francis Lightfoot Lee, son of our old friend Thomas
Lee, was selected and settled himself on lands which he had inherited
from his father and which were within the boundaries of the new
county. His residence in Loudoun, however, did not prove to be
permanent, for upon his marriage in 1769, to Miss Rebecca Tayloe
of Mount Airy, he removed to Menokin on the Rappahannock
where he continued to reside until his death, without issue, in the
winter of 1797; but as a result of his frontier experience he was always
thereafter called "Loudoun" by his brothers.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> In addition to
his position as county lieutenant he and James Hamilton served as
the first Burgesses from Loudoun and continuously so acted for a
number of years.</p>

<p>The first county surveyor was recognized at the court held on
the 9th August, 1757, when "George West, Gent. produced a
Commission to be Surveyor of this County and thereupon he took
the Oath directed by the Act of Assembly and entered into and
acknowledged his Bond to the President and Masters of the College
of William &amp; Mary in Virginia with Charles Binns &amp; Lee Massey
his Sureties which is Ordered to be recorded."</p>

<p>The first attorneys to qualify to practice law before the Loudoun
Court were Hugh West, Benjamin Sebastian, William Elzey, and
James Keith.</p>

<p>Few institutions of the Northern Neck of those days of slow travel
and thin settlement were more important than the inns or as they
are usually designated "ordinaries;" and the keeper of an Ordinary
was generally a man of parts and consequence in his community.
The matter of cost of food, drink and lodging in the public inns was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
a subject close to the heart of the eighteenth century colonial and
Loudoun's Court lost no time in taking control of the ordinaries within
its boundaries. Already several were in existence. As early as 1740
William West had acquired land on the Carolina Road near the
present Aldie and soon had constructed a dwelling and was keeping
an ordinary there. The Loudoun Court on the 9th May, 1759, gave
him a license to keep his ordinary for a year&mdash;presumably to be annually
renewed&mdash;but he had been acting as the local Boniface for
many years before that. The first Loudoun license for an ordinary,
however, was granted on the 10th August, 1757, "to James Coleman
to keep Ordinary at his House in this County (at the Sugar
Lands) for one Year he with Security having given Bond as the Law
directs;" but Coleman, too, had been conducting an ordinary at his
residence before then.</p>

<p>On the 12th September, 1759, the court licensed John Moss to
keep an Ordinary at Leesburg.</p>

<p>But on the 9th day of August, 1757, the day before it granted its
first license to keep ordinary to James Coleman, the court laid down
its rules and regulations for Loudoun inn keepers. That the gentlemen
justices gave far more detailed attention to the charges for alcoholic
refreshment than to the other matters regulated may or may
not have been mere coincidence.</p>

<p>"The Court," so runs the record, "proceeded to rate the Liquor
for this County as follows:</p>

<p>"Ordered that the respective Ordinary keepers in this County do
sell according to the above rates in Money or Tobacco at the rate of
12s 6d per hundred and that they do not presume to demand more
of any Person whatsoever."</p>

<p>The first deed recorded in Loudoun but on page 2 of the first volume
of Deed Books, is dated the 6th day of August, 1757, from
Andrew Hutchison "of Loudoun County and Cameron Parish"
and runs to his sons John and Daniel, also of Loudoun; it conveys a
piece of land "containing by estimation seven hundred acres more or
less whereon now lives the said John Huchison and to be equally
divided between them." Thus another old and well-known Loudoun
family is introduced.</p>

<p>The first will recorded was that of "Evan Thomas of Virginia
Coleney in Loudoun County." It was proved at the court held on
the 8th day of November, 1757, and its record is followed by a
long and interesting inventory of his estate.</p>

<p>For some time prior to the organization of the county there had
been a small backwoods settlement, perhaps only a few scattered log
houses, near the intersection of the Carolina and old Ridge Roads.
This tiny hamlet had dignified itself with the name of George Town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
in rugged loyalty to King George the Second. Deck and Heaton say
that in 1757 a little fort was built there. Protection from attack by
the French and Indians was deemed necessary to every frontier
settlement. Nicholas Minor, who was a captain in the Virginia
Militia and in active service at this period, may have had a hand in
the building of this fort and it is probable that he was in military
command there. He lived on his nearby plantation of Fruitland and
his estate included some sixty acres or more at the intersection of the
Carolina and Ridge Roads. In the year 1756, it is believed, he employed
John Hough (who, as stated in the last chapter, had in 1744
settled in these backwoods and was acting as a surveyor for Lord
Fairfax) to survey this land for a town site. Hough thereupon made
his survey and perhaps mapped his first rough draft in 1757, probably
making a more carefully detailed copy in 1759, after the establishment
of the Town had been formally authorized by the Legislature
and Minor had sold off a number of the lots as plotted on the plan.
If so, this first rough draft is now lost or has been destroyed and the
copy of 1759 was destined for many years also to be involved in
mysterious disappearance. Though constantly in use for the first
forty years of its existence, through oversight or negligence neither
this 1759 "edition," nor the original draft, had been entered on the
county records. Then in the latter part of the eighteenth century, the
1759 copy was used as an exhibit in the suit of Cavan vs. Murray,
involving land adjacent to the town and in 1798 folded up and filed
with the county clerk together with other exhibits in that litigation.
The story of its disappearance and recovery is attached to a photostatic
copy of the map now before me:</p>

<p>"For generations the mystery of its disappearance has been a subject
of speculation and many believed that it had been withdrawn
from the public records into private lands, and there held or possibly
lost. In November 1928, the bundle containing the papers in the
above suit was opened by Charles F. Cochran, and the old plat
brought to light, just 130 years after it had been placed there. The
paper was worn through at many of the creases, being completely in
two through the middle, many minute bits were turned under or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
hanging only by a shred, and in places there has been shrinkage.
Through the courtesy of Dr. Herbert Putnam, Librarian of Congress,
and Col. Lawrence Martin, Chief of the Division of Maps,
and in return for permission to file a photostat of the plat in the
Library of Congress, the plat was mounted by Mr. William F.
Norbeck, the Library's expert in the restoration of old maps. It was
due to Mr. Henry B. Rust of Rockland, near Leesburg that the extended
search of the Loudoun County records was made, in which
the plat was brought to light, and he has had it framed."<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>This framed map of 1759 was presented to the county, by delivery
to Mr. B. W. Franklin, then county clerk of Loudoun, on the 30th
December, 1928, by Mr. E. Marshall Rust, the brother of Henry
B. Rust.</p>

<p>Upon the organization of the county, the matter of location and
establishment of a county seat had to be determined. It was not,
however, until the 15th June, 1758, that the Council of the Colony,
by deciding to locate the courthouse of Loudoun on the lands of
Nicholas Minor on the old Carolina Road near the crossing of the
Alexandria-Keys Gap Highway, fixed the importance of what was
to be known as Leesburg. The order of the Council reads:</p>

<p>"The Council having this day taken under Consideration the
most proper Place for establishing the Court House of Loudoun
County, it appearing to them that the plantation of Captain Nicholas
Minor was the most convenient place and agreeable to the Generality
of the People in that County, it was their opinion, and accordingly
Ordered, That the Court House for the said County be
fixed on the land of the said Minor."</p>

<p>When this order of the Council was made on the 15th June, 1758,
the Loudoun Court, as we have seen, had been duly organized and
from time to time was meeting for the performance of its duties
since the preceding 12th July. Where these early meetings were
held does not appear on the records, nor so far as I can learn, is now
known. The record of the court's sittings at the time generally begin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
"At a court held at the courthouse" so that the presumption
arises that, for the time being, the residence of one of its members
may have been used for that purpose. Apparently the court was becoming
impatient to have an official home and weary of the Council's
delay; for at the court's session of the 11th day of July, 1758, or four
days before the date of the Council's order, we find that it is, by the
Loudoun Court,</p>

<p>"Ordered that the Sheriff of this County Advertise for Workmen
to build a Courthouse to meet here at the next Court to agree for the
same."</p>

<p>The proposed edifice was so carefully described that we can get a
very clear idea of its appearance from the specifications recorded at
this session of the 9th August, 1758. It was to be a brick building
28 x 40, with a jury room added sixteen feet square, having "an outside
chimney and fireplace, eight feet in the clear from the foundation
to the surface, two feet from the surface to the water table
four feet, from thence to the joist ten feet." There significantly follows
"and also a Prison and Stocks of the same Dimensions as those
in Fairfax County for this County."<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>A month later, at the court's sitting of the 12th September, 1758,
it was</p>

<p>"Ordered that the courthouse for this County be Built on a Lott of
Captain Nicholas Minor's No. 27 and 28 and that he convey the
same to William West and James Hamilton Gent. as Trustees in
Fee for the use of the County."<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless no deed from Minor actually was obtained until
nearly three years later, as will subsequently appear. That shrewd
and careful Founder of Leesburg well might have been unwilling to
give to the county two of the best lots in his new subdivision until
he was abundantly protected; so the deed was not given until the
new courthouse was built and any lingering doubt removed from
his mind that the county's project would be carried out. At the court's
session of the 13th September, 1758, a contract to build the courthouse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
was confirmed to "Aeneas Campbell Gent." for the sum of
365 pounds current money to be paid in two equal payments, the
first on the first day of August next ensuing and the remaining half
in the year 1760, Campbell having given a bond for the due performance
of his contract. At the same session the contract to build
the "Goal and stocks for this county" was confirmed to "Daniel
French Gent" for 83 pounds current money to be paid on or before
the 20th day of August then next; and it is noted that Campbell
and French were the lowest bidders.</p>

<p>The building operations duly progressed. At the court held on
the 15th November, 1759, a levy was laid in tobacco for the compensation
of county officers and of 29,200 pounds of tobacco for the
balance due Campbell, referred to as being "late sheriff" and succeeded
by "Nicholas Minor Gt."</p>

<p>Upon completion of the building in 1761 the cautious Captain
Minor felt assurance to execute his deed to the county. On the 17th
day of June in that year he conveyed to "Francis Lightfoot Lee
Gentleman the first Justice named and nominated in the Commission
of the Peace for the said County of Loudoun for and in behalf of him
the said Francis Lightfoot Lee and the rest of the Justices in the said
Commission named and their and his successors" for the nominal
consideration of five shillings, "Current Money of Virginia, the two
Lots of Land situate lying and being in the Town of Leesburg in the
County and Colony aforesaid being the same whereon the Courthouse
and Prison now stand laid off and surveyed by John Hough
to contain each Lot half an Acre and numbered twenty seven and
twenty eight." There were some formal rites attending the transfer
of the land and the ancient "livery of seizin" ceremony was duly
enacted. Then, following the signature of Minor and his witnesses
to the deed:</p>

<p>"Memorandum that on the Eleventh Day of June Anno Domini
one Thousand seven hundred and sixty one full peaceable and Quiet
possession of the within mentioned premises was given by Nicholas
Minor Gent to Francis Lightfoot Lee and the other Justices within
named by delivery to him and them Turf and Twig on the said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
premises in the presence of the underwritten Persons then Present."<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>And finally, at the court held on the 12th November, 1761, it was</p>

<p>"Ordered that Nicholas Minor Gen't. and John Moss Junr. Agree
with Workmen to clear away the Bricks and Dirt about the Courthouse
and likewise for building a Necessary House and Posting and
Railing in the Courthouse Lott and bring in their Account at the
Laying of the next Levy."<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>And from that day to this the Loudoun courthouse, in its various
and successive reconstructions, has always stood on these lots of Captain
Nicholas Minor, thus granted by him to the county for that
purpose. In the process of time the prison, the stocks and the "Necessary
House" have been removed.</p>

<p>In September, 1758, the Assembly passed an act "erecting" Leesburg
as a town, in the same measure "erecting" Stephensburg and
enlarging Winchester, which act reads, in part, as follows:</p>

<p>"An Act for erecting a town on the land of Lewis Stephens, in
the county of Frederick: For enlarging the town of Winchester, and
for erecting a town on the land of Nicholas Minor, in the county
of Loudoun....</p>

<p>"III And whereas Nicholas Minor of the county of Loudoun,
gentleman, hath laid off sixty acres of his land, adjoining to the
court-house of the said county into lots, with proper streets for a
town, many of which lots are sold, and improvements made thereon,
and the inhabitants of the said county have petitioned this general
assembly that the same may be erected into a town, Be it therefore
enacted by the authority aforesaid, that the land so laid off into lots
and streets, for a town, by the said Nicholas Minor, be and the same
is hereby erected and established a town, and shall be called by the
name of Leesburg; and that the free holders and inhabitants thereof
shall for ever hereafter enjoy the same privileges which the inhabitants
of other towns, erected by act of Assembly, now enjoy.</p>

<p>"IV And whereas it is expedient that trustees should be appointed
to regulate the buildings in the said towns of Stephensburg,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Winchester and Leesburg: Be it therefore enacted by the authority
aforesaid, ... And that the honorable Philip Ludwell Lee, esquire,
Thomas Mason, esquire, Francis Lightfoot Lee, James Hamilton,
Nicholas Minor, Josias Clapham, Aeneas Campbell, John Hugh,
Francis Hague, and William West, gentlemen, be constituted and
appointed trustees for the said town of Leesburg; and that they, or
any five or more of them, are hereby authorized and empowered,
from time to time, and all times hereafter, to settle and establish
such rules and orders for the more regular and orderly building of
the houses in the said town of Leesburg, as to them shall seem best
and most convenient. And in the case of death or removal, or other
legal disability of any one or more of the trustees above mentioned, it
shall and may be lawful for the surviving or remaining trustees of
the said towns of Stephensburg, Winchester, and Leesburg, respectively,
from time to time, to elect and choose so many other persons
in the room of those so dead, removed or disabled, as shall make up
the number of ten; which trustees, so chosen, shall by all intents
and purposes be vested with the same power as any other in this Act
particularly named."<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>Of the members of the Lee family participating in the early affairs
of the town and county or owning land in Loudoun, it is generally
held that the new town was named in honour of Francis Lightfoot
Lee, the first county lieutenant. Thus the Lees are appropriately
and locally commemorated, though their river still remains Goose
Creek and the county of their large holdings goes by another and
less congruous name.</p>

<p>Now it must be remembered that in this year of 1758 which
marked the formal recognition and naming of Leesburg, the French
and Indian menace was a very real and terrible anxiety in the minds
of the Loudoun settlers and had been responsible for the erection of
the small frontier fort at this point which has been mentioned. The
local tradition that the little town, when first built, was surrounded
by a timber stockade seems not only plausible but highly probable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
It was a well established custom of the English Colonists on the
Indian frontier, north and south, to protect their outlying villages
in that manner. Leesburg people always insist that the noticeable
crowding together of houses in the older part of the town and the
pronounced local custom of building immediately on the street line
is a survival of this very early need of concentration for protection.</p>

<p>Where the two main roads, to which the town owes its existence,
passed through its future site, they followed the old Virginia custom
in being decidedly indefinite in their bounds; and their condition
was further complicated by the ground at this point being marshy
and fed by numerous springs. Therefore even before Leesburg was
laid out or Loudoun organized, the people living in the neighborhood
had petitioned the Fairfax Court for the construction of a highway
at that point in such manner as would be most convenient for
the travel from Noland's Ferry to the Carolinas. When Loudoun was
organized the petition was certified to the court of the new county
which, in its November term of 1757, ordered that the roads leading
from Alexandria to Winchester and from Noland's Ferry to the
Carolinas be opened to go through that neighbourhood "in the most
convenient manner;" and James Hamilton, John Moss and Thomas
Sorrell were ordered "to view the most convenient way for the same
and make report to the Court." These viewers proceeded to so
efficiently fulfill their duties that when they eventually reported to
the court, on the 12th April, 1758, that they had "viewed the
most convenient way for the Roads to pass through the Town and
find them convenient and good with proper clearing,"<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> a corduroy
road had been constructed through the marshy ground and Hough
was thus able to have his King Street in definite bounds when he
mapped his survey for Minor.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>ADOLESCENCE</h3>


<p>Our upper country, at last, has graduated from being
classified as merely part of the backwoods of Lord
Fairfax's Northern Neck and is now enrolled in the rapidly
growing roster of colonial Virginia's counties. Unfortunately the
conferring of that dignity did not alter the social problems of the
frontier nor change, to any great degree, the turbulence and
heterogeneous character of its population. The Irish element, particularly,
appears to have been pugnacious and lawless, if one may
judge from the frequency of proceedings before the Court for "battery"
wherein defendants carry distinctly Hibernian names. There
was no dearth of business, civil or criminal, awaiting the court's sessions.</p>

<p>Those of the poorer class, however, were not alone in taking the
law into their own hands. Cameron Parish, as heretofore appears,
was set up in 1748. Whether its vestry was more arbitrary and tenacious
of office or merely less diplomatic than was the rule elsewhere is
not clear; but that there developed great dissatisfaction with its activities
the records show. The Parish vestry, it will be remembered,
exercised many powers of civil government. Originally the vestry of
twelve gentlemen and their successors were chosen by vote of the
parishioners; but gradually the practice developed in existing vestries,
upon the death or resignation of a member, for the survivors themselves
arbitrarily to appoint his successor. There never was unanimity
of religious belief in Cameron the Parish nor in Loudoun the county.
From the very beginning, as we have seen, the land was peopled by
men and women of definitely divergent religious views&mdash;the Churchmen
from Tidewater with some Baptists and Presbyterians, a large
number of Quakers from Pennsylvania, Germans from overseas and
no small number whose religious convictions, if existent, were of
nebulous tenuity. Had the vestries stood annually for election the
populace might have felt more closely represented; but with their
membership exclusively taken from the landowning class which
had migrated from the lower country, the Quakers, the Scotch-Irish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the Germans accepted a somewhat arbitrary rule less willingly than
were they all churchmen and meeting together in common worship.
The friction was not confined to Cameron. Similar troubles had
developed elsewhere and petitions had been sent to Williamsburg
for relief. In 1759 the Legislature decided to act. "Whereas" reads
the preamble to Chapter XXI of the Laws of 1758-59</p>

<p>"it has been represented to this present General Assembly, that
the Vestries of the parish of Antrim, in the County of Halifax; of
the parish of Cameron in the County of Loudoun; of the parish of
Bath, in the County of Dinwiddie; and of the parish of Saint-Patrick,
in the County of Prince Edward, have been guilty of arbitrary
and illegal practices to the great oppression of the inhabitants
of said parishes ... and the inhabitants of said parishes have respectively
petitioned this Assembly that the said vestries may be
dissolved;"<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>the Legislature thereupon dissolved the vestries named, their
future acts were "declared utterly void to all intents and purposes
whatsoever" and the freeholders and housekeepers of the respective
parishes authorized to meet, on notice, and "elect twelve of the most
able &amp; discreet persons of the said parishes respectively to be vestrymen
of the same." So far was the Legislature willing to go; but the
orthodox rulers of Virginia did not for a moment propose to turn
over control of the vestries in the dissatisfied parishes to a dissenting
element; there was a further provision that should any vestrymen
dissent from the communion of the Church of England and join
"themselves to a dissenting congregation, and yet continue to act as
vestrymen" they should be displaced.</p>

<p>During the ensuing ten years Loudoun's population grew rapidly
and a parish extending from Difficult Run to the Blue Ridge covered
so much territory that it made it difficult for a vestry, chosen from
different parts of the parish, to assemble frequently for business.
The project of dividing Cameron was the subject of a petition to
the Legislature in 1769 but because of opposition and disagreement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the division was not made until June, 1770, when an act was passed
creating a new parish beyond Goose Creek and running to the Blue
Ridge.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> It was given the name of Shelburne in compliment to the
British statesman William Petty-FitzMaurice, Lord Shelburne.</p>

<p>This contemplated division of Cameron had repercussions in the
relations between that parish and its mother parish Truro. The new
Shelburne would take from Cameron many of its tithables or taxpayers
and suggested intensive study of its remaining economic
resources. In November, 1766, or twenty-eight years after the
creation of Cameron, the Legislature passed an act empowering
Truro's vestry to sell its parish Glebe and church plate and divide
the proceeds between Truro and Cameron; while three years later,
in the act creating Shelburne, it was provided that as the Cameron
Glebe was then located inconveniently, the latter's vestry was
authorized to sell it and use the proceeds "toward purchasing a more
convenient glebe, and erecting buildings thereon, for the use and
benefit of the minister of the said parish of Cameron, for the
time being, forever."<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

</div>


<p>The parish well may continue to take satisfaction in having been
named worthily. Shelburne came of an historical and noble family,
being a direct descendant of the very ancient Lords of Kerry. Born
in Dublin on the 20th May, 1737, his childhood is said to have been
"spent in the remotest parts of the south of Ireland and according to
his own account when he entered Christ Church, Oxford in 1755
he had both everything to learn and everything to unlearn." Perhaps
his friendship and conciliatory attitude always shewn toward the
American Colonies arose from his naturally amiable and considerate
disposition, perhaps from his participation under Wolfe in campaigns
against the French. However that may be, he was well-liked
and trusted in Virginia. He succeeded his father as Earl of Shelburne
in 1761. During the critical years of 1766 and 1767 he was serving,
under Pitt, as Secretary of State and sought, as a friend of the
Colonies, to avoid the crisis which was surely developing. Unfortunately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
his efforts toward conciliation were blocked by others
of the ministry and the King and in 1768 Shelburne was dismissed.
In 1782 he reassumed office under Lord Rockingham, with the express
understanding that the independence of the American Colonies
should be recognized; an attitude requiring courage and strength
to maintain. When Rockingham died, Shelburne succeeded him
as Premier but through an alliance of Fox with Shelburne's old
enemy North, he was forced to resign that position in 1783. A year
later, when Pitt returned to power, he caused Shelburne to be created
first Marquis of Landsdowne with which his public career ended.
He was succeeded in his titles and estates, upon his death on the
7th May, 1805, by his eldest son.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>More fortunate in its fate than the early vestry books of Cameron,
which have been destroyed or lost, the first vestry book of Shelburne,
covering the period from 1771 to 1805, has been preserved and after
being for many years in the library of the Episcopal Theological
Seminary at Alexandria was sent to the State Library in Richmond.
A photostatic copy has been made and is held in Loudoun.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>By way of contrast to the first vestry books of Virginia's older
parishes, the earliest entries in that of Shelburne do not yield a great
amount of interesting material. Its pages are largely filled with details
of the levy of taxes and there is a protracted quarrel over the
sites to be chosen for new church buildings which, in the event,
prevented action until the Revolution and its aftermath deprived the
Vestries of much of their authority. A few entries in the Vestry
book have been abstracted:</p>

<p>"30th November 1772 Ordered that the Church Wardens for
the Present Year do provide Benches to accomodate the persons who
come to attend Divine Service at the Court House in Leesburg."</p>

<p>And then, to shew what a Church the Parish might have had but
did not, there is this entry on the 30th December 1774. (Page 30)
"Ordered that there be a Church built at or near the place
where the Chapple now stands at Stephen Rozels and that it be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
50 feet long &amp; 40 feet broad in the clear. To be built either of
brick or stone. To be of Sufficient Pitch for two rows of Windows,
if built of brick the wall to be 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> brick thick if built of stone the
walls to be 2 feet thick; the Pews &amp; all the Carpenter work to be
of pine plank (framing excepted) The Base to be of Stone 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> feet
thick &amp; to be finished off in such manner as the person appointed
shall direct."</p>

<p>From the 10th day of June, 1776, no meeting of the vestry is
recorded until the 1st day of April 1779.</p>

<p>At the meeting of the 4th November, 1795, Mr. Jones, the minister
was ordered to preach "one Sunday at the Church at Rozels
&amp; the rest at Leesburg."</p>

<p>Thus the county was divided into two parishes. A little later
Cameron secured the services, as Parson, of a member of another
well-known family of the Northern Neck when, in 1771, the Rev.
Spence Grayson returned from his theological studies and ordination
in England and assumed that position. He was the son of Benjamin
Grayson and Susan Monroe and had inherited from his father his
home, Belle Air, in Prince William County which he left to
go to England to enter the church. He married Mary Elizabeth
Wagener, sister to Colonel Peter Wagener (clerk of Fairfax County
and subsequently an officer in the Revolution) and became one of
the original trustees in 1788 of the town of Carrborough on the
south side of the mouth of Quantico Creek, where now are situated
the Marine Corps Barracks. His nephew was the well-known
Colonel William Grayson who, after serving with distinction in the
Revolution, became one of the original two senators from Virginia.</p>

<p>But Shelburne was not to be cast in the shade in this matter of
Parsons. In 1771 there was inducted there as minister the man who,
of her long line of clergy, has left in Church, State, and Nation the
most prominent name of all. The Rev. Dr. David Griffith had been
born in the city of New York in 1742. Like the Rev. Charles Green,
early minister of Truro, Dr. Griffith first became a physician, taking
his medical degree in London and then returning to New York and
beginning his practice as a physician there in 1763. Determining to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
enter the church ministry, he returned to England and was ordained
in London by Bishop Terrick on the 19th August, 1770. Again he
returned to America and worked as a missionary in New Jersey,
whence he came to take charge of Shelburne Parish in 1771. When
the Revolution came on, he, in 1776, became Chaplain of the 3rd
Virginia Regiment and, in December of that year, he "was acting
as a surgeon in the Continental Army in Philadelphia." Long a
close and confidential friend of George Washington, he became the
Rector of Christ Church, Alexandria, in 1780, in which position he
continued until his death. He was a leader in building up the church
in Virginia from its depressed condition after the Revolution, was a
member of its first convention in Richmond in 1785 and was elected
first Bishop of Virginia at the second annual convention of the
Diocese in May, 1786. Unfortunately there were no funds available
to pay his expenses to England and thus he was never formally consecrated.
He died at the house of Bishop White in Philadelphia, while
attending a church convention there, in 1789. He has been described
as "large and tall in person but firm in manner. Without perhaps
being brilliant, he was an able man of sound judgment and consecrated
life, who had the esteem and affection as well as the confidence
of his contemporaries. His memory ought to be held by us
in highest honour."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>In those days Loudoun shared, with other of Virginia's frontier
counties, a pest of numerous wolves which indeed penetrated into
the older counties as well. There was a broad demand that the
bounty for killing the animals be increased and in 1765 the Assembly
passed an act authorizing Loudoun and six other counties to pay
larger bounties, providing that a person killing a wolf within their
respective boundaries "shall have an additional reward of fifty
pounds of neat tobacco for every young wolf not exceeding the age
of six months, and for every wolf above that age one hundred pounds
of neat tobacco, to be levied and paid in the respective counties where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the service shall be performed."<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The act was to continue in force,
however, only three years.</p>

<p>Five years later the hunting activities of Leesburg, at least, took
on a more domestic hue. The inhabitants of the little town were
busy in building up the reputation of a famous Virginia delicacy
but apparently were rather overdoing it. "It is represented" reads an
act of 1772 "that a great number of hogs are raised and suffered to
go at large in the town of Leesburg, in the county of Loudoun to
the great prejudice of the inhabitants thereof;" so the act forbade
owners from allowing such liberties to their porkers and permitted
any person to "kill and destroy such swine so running at large."<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>That Francis Aubrey established the first ferry from Loudoun's
shore across the Potomac prior to 1741 has been noted in Chapter
IV. It was at the Point of Rocks and was inherited by Thomas
Aubrey, son of its founder, who obtained a license for its operation
in 1769. By 1775 the travel was very light at that point and complaint
was made of inadequate equipment. In 1834 it, with the surrounding
land on the Loudoun side, was in the possession of Rebecca
Johnson and in 1837 in that of Margaret Graham. The construction
of the Point of Rocks bridge by the Potomac Bridge Company in
1847 ended its usefulness.</p>

<p>A second ferry, also across the Potomac and heretofore recorded,
became far more famous than that of the Aubreys. When Philip
Noland acquired land on that river where travel over the old Carolina
Road had, from time immemorial, crossed it, he had the most
valuable and frequented ferry-site in the neighborhood. He had
sought, but unsuccessfully, a ferry license as early as 1748; in 1756,
with or without a license, he was operating his ferry. Its operation
was eventually authorized by the Legislature in 1778 to the land of
Arthur Nelson in the State of Maryland. No other ferry from
Loudoun's shores acquired the fame that did Noland's. At the
height of its activities the travel at that point is said to have supported
a country store, a blacksmith's shop, a wagon shop, a tailor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
and a shoemaker. The coming of the railroads and the construction
of the Point of Rocks Bridge together were responsible for its ultimate
abandonment. We have a suggestive glimpse of conditions
there. In May, 1780, the Moravian emissary John Frederick Reichel,
in the course of his ministrations to those of his faith in America,
undertook a journey from Bethlehem in Pennsylvania down the
Carolina Road to the present Winston-Salem in North Carolina. One
of his companions kept a journal from which we learn that upon successfully
crossing into Virginia at Noland's Ferry, Bishop Reichel and
his company "made camp near Mr. Th. Noland's house close to
the road which turns to the right from the Foart road towards Noland's
Ferry which crosses the Patomoak two miles from here. So far
our journey had been very pleasant. Now, however, the Virginia air
brought storms." While the weary travelers were resting that night
from their journey, some of Noland's negroes left their "Quarters"
and proceeded to lay their hands on the strangers' equipment. The
diarist on the next day indignantly records the following "Note.
Mr. Th. Noland and his father and father in law have 200 negroes
in this neighbourhood on both sides of the Potomoack and this
neighbourhood is far-famed for robbery and theft." On their return
the travellers found that Mr. Noland had busied himself in recapturing
much of the loot and duly returned the articles to their rightful
owners.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>Between Noland and Josias Clapham there was a controversy for
many years over which of the two should control the very profitable
ferry business over the nearby stretches of the Potomac. Both had
powerful associations and friends and both were, through their own
activities and characters, outstanding figures in the Loudoun of
their day. Noland as the son-in-law of the most prominent of
Loudoun's earliest settlers, Francis Aubrey, and through his wife
in possession of part of Aubrey's great land-grants, could well have
entertained a conviction that he was Aubrey's representative and as
such entitled to especial consideration as well as for his own accomplishments;
while, on the other hand, Clapham's inherited friendship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
with Lord Fairfax and his own recent military services as a lieutenant
in the troublous times following Braddock's defeat and death,
his early and continued ownership of extensive tracts of land, his
sound personal qualities and the high esteem in which he was held
by his neighbours, made him a formidable opponent and rival. He
successfully fought Noland's application to the Legislature for a
ferry license in 1756 and in 1757 obtained one himself for the
operation of a ferry below that of Noland, "from the lands of Josias
Clapham, in the County of Fairfax, over Potowmack river, to the
land on either side of Monochisey creek, in the province of Maryland;
the price for a man four pence &amp; for a horse the same."<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
Though this license was afterwards suspended, Clapham appears
to have operated his ferry until 1778 when the Legislature ordered
it discontinued as inconvenient. As Clapham at that time was himself
a member of that body, it is probable that the old rivalry between
the neighbours had ended.</p>

<p>We learn something of yet another ferry from this same act of
the Legislature passed in the war year of 1778. Therein it was also
provided "that publick ferries be constantly kept at the following
places and the rates for passing the same be as follows, that is to say:
From the land of the earl of Tankerville, in the County of Loudoun
(at present in the tenure of Christian Shimmer) across Potowmack
river to the opposite shore in the state of Maryland, the price for a
man eight pence, and for a horse the same: ..." The act authorized
Noland to collect the same tolls at his ferry, thus permitting the
doubling of the ferry charges by the act of 1757.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>REVOLUTION</h3>


<p>When the American Colonies joined issue with Great
Britain in the controversy which was to result in American
independence, Loudoun's population, beginning
with a thin trickle of adventurers, had been growing for over fifty
years, during which time, save for the short period before and after
Braddock's defeat, her sure but steady development and increase
of people had received no serious reversal. The exact number of her
inhabitants in 1775 is unknown; but fifteen years later she was
credited with 14,747 whites and 4,030 slaves or a total of 18,777
individuals. One writer goes so far as to assert that the county was
one of the most densely populated in the Colony at that period.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
Toward the close of the conflict, in 1780 and 1781, her militia numbered
no less than 1746 men, which is claimed by Head to have
been "far in excess of that reported by any other Virginia County."
When it is remembered that her present population does not greatly
exceed 20,000 inhabitants and that, in the years which have intervened,
the towns have substantially increased in number and size,
it is probable that the country districts were quite as populous in
1775 as they are today.</p>

<p>With her early diversity of population, it might well be expected
that the county's inhabitants would be divided in their attitude as
to the wisdom of war with England. There seems, however, to have
been practically a solid front, save for the Quakers who, because of
their oppugnance to all war, opposed the Revolution in Loudoun as
elsewhere and suffered bitterly in consequence as later will be related.</p>

<p>As it was, Loudoun lost no time in placing herself on record, as
the following amply demonstrates:</p>

<p>"At a meeting of the Freeholders and other inhabitants of the
County of Loudoun, in the Colony of Virginia, held at the Courthouse
in Leesburg, the 14th June 1774&mdash;F. Peyton, Esq., in the
chair&mdash;to consider the most effective method to preserve the rights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
and liberties of N. America, and relieve our brethren of Boston,
suffering under the most oppressive and tyranical Act of the British
Parliament, made in the 14th year of his present Majesty's reign,
whereby their Harber is blocked up, their commerce totally obstructed,
their property rendered useless</p>

<p>"<i>Resolved</i>, That we will always cheerfully submit to such prerogatives
as his Majesty has a right, by law, to exercise, as Sovereign
of the British Dominions, and to no others.</p>

<p>"<i>Resolved</i>, That it is beneath the dignity of freemen to submit to
any tax not imposed on them in the usual manner, by representatives
of their own choosing.</p>

<p>"<i>Resolved</i>, That the Act of the British Parliament above mentioned,
is utterly repugnant to the fundamental laws of justice, in
punishing persons without even the form of a trial; but a despotic
exertion of unconstitutional power designedly calculated to enslave
a free and loyal people.</p>

<p>"<i>Resolved</i>, That the enforcing the execution of the said Act of
Parliament by a military power, must have a necessary tendency to
raise a civil war, and that we will, with our lives and fortunes, assist
our suffering brethren of Boston, and every part of North America
that may fall under the immediate hand of oppression, until a release
of all our grievances shall be procurred; and our common liberties
established on a permanent foundation.</p>

<p>"<i>Resolved</i>, That the East India Company, by exporting their tea
from England to America, whilst subject to a tax imposed thereon
by the British Parliament, have evidently designed to fix on the
Americans those chains forged for them by a venal ministry, and
have thereby rendered themselves odious and detestable throughout
all America. It is, therefore, the unanimous opinion of this meeting
not to purchase any tea or other East India commodity whatever,
imported after the first of this Month.</p>

<p>"<i>Resolved</i>, That we will have no Commercial intercourse with
Great Britain until the above mentioned Act of Parliament shall be
totally repealed, and the right of regulating the internal policy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
N. America by a British Parliament shall be absolutely and positively
given up.</p>

<p><i>"Resolved,</i> That Thompson Mason and Francis Peyton, Esqs., be
appointed to represent the County at a general meeting to be held at
Williamsburg on the 1st day of August next, to take the sense of
this Colony on the subject of the preceeding resolves, and that they,
together with Leven Powell, William Ellzey, John Thornton,
George Johnston and Samuel Levi, or any three of them, be a committee
to correspond with the several Committees appointed for
this purpose</p>

<p>By a stroke of good fortune, there has been brought to light and
published in recent years a journal kept by one Nicholas Cresswell,
a young Englishman of gentle birth who, in 1774, at the age of 24
years obeyed a keen impulse to emigrate to Virginia with the expectation
of buying a plantation and becoming a Virginia farmer.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
His home in England was the estate of his father, known as Crowden-le-Booth,
in the parish of Edale in the Peak of Derbyshire. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
father seems to have been a somewhat stern disciplinarian, against
the rigidity of whose rule and unhappy home conditions young
Cresswell fretted; and that and an ambition to make his own way in
the world, coupled with an appetite for adventure common to his
age and race, induced Nicholas to his course. After many difficulties,
he sailed from England in the ship <i>Molly</i> on the 9th of April, 1774,
and thus began a series of adventures, his excellent record of which
has been characterized as "a valuable addition to Revolutionary
Americana" and, it may be added, is nothing less than treasure trove
to the student of Loudoun's past. In the course of his ensuing experiences
he met, among a multitude of others, Jefferson, Lord
Howe, Patrick Henry, Francis Lightfoot Lee; was upon occasion
Washington's guest at Mount Vernon and paints and proves Thomson
Mason to have been one of the kindliest and most hospitable of
men. His wanderings took him through many parts of Virginia and
particularly Leesburg and its neighborhood, Maryland, Pennsylvania,
New York; on a voyage to Barbados to recoup his health and
on an expedition as a viewer and surveyor of new lands, down the
Ohio River into Indiana country, in an unsuccessful effort to recoup
his fortune. An educated young Englishman, loyal to his King and
country, arriving in the Colonies as the storm of the Revolution was
about to break, he soon was suspected of being an English spy, was
bullied and persecuted by some, befriended by others and, withal,
records his experiences in a narrative of such fascination that one
reads it from end to end with unabated interest. Of the Leesburg
and Loudoun of the period he gives the best contemporary, if not
always complimentary, account known to the present writer.
Through the courtesy of the Dial Press, the publishers of his
Journal in the United States, the following abstract of Loudoun material
is permitted:</p>

</div>

<p>Cresswell first passed through Loudoun in November, 1774, in
the course of a journey to the Valley. He arrived in Leesburg on Sunday
the 27th and records:</p>

<p>"The land begins to grow better. A Gravelly soil and produces
good Wheat, but the roads are very bad, cut to pieces with the wagons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
number of them we met today. Their method of mending the
roads is with poles about 10 foot long laid across the road close together;
they stick fast in the mud and make an excellent causeway.
Very thinly peopled along the road, almost all Woods. Only one
public House between this place and Alexandria."</p>

<p>On the next day he inspected Leesburg. "Viewing the town. It
is regularly laid off in squares, but very indifferently built and few
inhabitants and little trade, tho' very advantageously situated, for it
is at the conjunction of the great Roads from the North part of the
Continent to the South and the East and the West. Lodged at Mr.
Moffit's, Mr. Kirk's partner in a store which he has here."</p>

<p>On the following Sunday, "Went to a Methodist meeting. This
Sect is scattered in every place and have got considerable footing
here, owing to the great negligence of the Church Parsons."</p>

<p>The next day he continued his journey to the West, returning to
Leesburg on the 14th December, 1774. On the following day, being
Sunday, he simply notes "but no prayers." On Monday, "Court
day. A great number of litigious suits. The people seem to be fond
of Law. Nothing uncommon for them to bring suit against a person
for a Book debt and trade with him on an open account at the same
time. To be arrested for debt is no scandal here." And on the next
day he "Saw the Independence Company exercise. A ragged crew."
In January he amuses himself "with shooting wild Geese and Ducks.
Here is incredible numbers in the River likewise Swans. It is said they
come from the Lakes."</p>

<p>Again on his way to the West, this time to the Indian country, he
arrived in Leesburg on Sunday the 26th March, 1775. On the following
Wednesday he "went to look at a silver mine. Saw some appearance
of metal but don't know what it is." On the 31st: "At Leesburg
waiting for my gun and goods coming from Alexandria. The
Peach Orchards are in full blossom and make a beautiful appearance."
On the following Sunday, the 2nd April, he notes "But no
Parson. It is a shame to suffer these people to neglect their duty in
the manner they do."</p>

<p>After his journey in the "Illinois Country" we find him again in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Leesburg in the employment of one Kirk, a merchant of Alexandria
who, son of a blacksmith in Cresswell's home parish, had gone to
Virginia and prospered there. On Sunday, the 19th November,
1775, Nicholas records that he "went to Church or Courthouse
which you please in the forenoon" thus further confirming that the
established church services were, at that time, held in the courthouse
at Leesburg. Cresswell meets and is much in the company of
George Johnston, Captain McCabe, George Ancram, and Captain
Douglas. As a sidelight on Leesburg's evening diversions of the
period, he writes under date of the 28th November that he "dined
at Captn. McCabe's in Company with Captn. Douglas and Cavan.
Spent the evening at the store in company with Captn. McCabe and
Captn. Speake and all of us got drunk."</p>

<p>On the 4th December he made a short visit to "Frederick Town
in Maryland," and, both going and some days later on his return,
dined at Noland's Ferry, suggesting some accommodation for travellers
there. On Sunday the 10th December, he "went to Church,
spent the evening at Mr. Johnson's with the Rev. Mr. David Griffiths
and several gentlemen."</p>

<p>He was a guest at "Garalland, seat of Captn. William Douglas. A
great deal of agreeable Company and very merry." On the next day
there was "Dancing and playing at Cards. In the evening several of
the company went in quest of a poor Englishman, who they supposed
had made songs on the Committee, but did not find him."
This week was one of celebration; on the following Friday, (5th
January, 1776) "This being my birthday, invited Captn. McCabe,
H. Neilson, W. Johnston, Matthews, Booker and my particular
Friend P. Cavan to spend the evening with me. We have kept it
up all night and I am at this time very merry." On Saturday:
"Spent the evening at Mr. Johnston's with our last night's company.
He is going to camp. All of us got most feloniously drunk.
Captn. McCabe, Hugh Neilson and I kept it up all night." On
Sunday: "went to bed about two o'clock in the afternoon, stupidly
drunk. Not been in bed or asleep for two nights."</p>

<p>A party was a party in the Leesburg of 1776.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>Virginia was heading toward independence, with war if need be.
Popular sentiment is shown by such entries as "Nothing but Independence
will go down. The Devil is in the people." "All in confusion.
The Committee met to choose Officers for the new Company
that are to be raised. They are 21 in number, the first men in the
County and had two bowls of toddy," (he carefully explains elsewhere
that "toddy" means punch) "but could not find cash to pay
for it." On the 12th February, "Court day. Great Confusion, no
business done. The populace deters the Magistrates and they in turn
are courting the rebels' favour. Enlisting men for the Rebel Army
upon credit. Their paper money is not yet arrived from the Mine."
On the 22nd March he "went to see the general musters of the
Militia in town, about 700 men but few arms." On Sunday the 17th
May he says: "This day is appointed by the Great Sanhedrim to
be kept an Holy Fast throughout the continent, but we have no
prayers in Leesburg. The Parson (Rev. David Griffiths) is gone into
the Army."</p>

<p>He has this to say about a Quaker meeting in February, probably
at Waterford, to which he went with his friends Cavan and Thomas
Matthews. "This is one of the most comfortable places of worship I
was ever in, they had two large fires and a Dutch stove. After a long
silence and many groans a Man got up and gave us a short Lecture
with great deliberation. Dined at Mr. Jos. Janney's one of the
Friends."</p>

<p>It was not until the 24th April, 1776, that Thomson Mason, who
was to prove so consistently a friend to him, is introduced, when
Cresswell notes that he was a dinner guest at his home&mdash;presumably
Raspberry Plain. By that time Cresswell had made a host of acquaintances
and friends. He enjoyed popularity with his new companions,
frequently was entertained or was a host himself. To add
to his scanty resources, he made lye, nitre and saltpetre on shares
and his process and progress he records in detail. His work was interrupted
by frequent illness, due doubtless to the heavy drinking indulged
in by him and his associates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>On the 9th July, 1776, he learns, to his dismay, of the <i>Declaration
of Independence</i>.</p>

<p>From time to time he dined with Thomson Mason who on the
26th July "proffers to give me a letter of recommendation to the
Governor Henry for liberty to go on board the Fleet in the Bay. I
have no other choice to go home but this;" and on the next day, "a
general muster of the Militia. Great confusion among them. Recruiting
parties offer 10 Dollars advance and 40 S per month."</p>

<p>But Cresswell realized the increasing danger to him, loyal Briton
that he was, of a continued stay in America. In August he determined
to go to New York for he was convinced that he "must
either escape that way or go to jail for Toryism." He did not tell Mr.
Mason of his design to leave the county, but only that he contemplated
a northern journey; and from him obtained a "letter to
Messrs. Francis Lightfoot Lee, Thos. Stone, Thos. Jefferson and
John Rogers Esq., all members of the Congress." On the 23rd
August "in company with Mr. Alexander Cooper, a Storekeeper
in town" he left Leesburg for the north.</p>

<p>He duly arrived in Philadelphia which greatly pleased him in its
size and cleanliness.</p>

<p>He calls on Lee and Jefferson, presents his letters, is kindly received
and through the latter obtains "a pass written by Mr. John
Hancock, Pres. of the Congress." Thence to New York, where he
sees the British Army and ships in the distance but cannot reach
them and begins to feel that to do so would be a dishonourable return
for Thomson Mason's kindness. So back again to Leesburg he
journeys, bewailing his situation but to his credit determining "to
rot in a Jail rather than take up Arms against my native country."</p>

<p>On the 10th October, 1776, the 6th Regiment of Virginians, encamped
at Leesburg on their way to the North, are described as "a
set of dirty, ragged people, badly clothed, badly disciplined and
badly armed." Salt was selling there at "Forty shillings, Currency,
per Bushel. This article usually sold for four shillings. If no salt comes
in there will be an insurrection in the Colony." In Alexandria a few
days later, he learns that the committee "will not permit me to depart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
this Colony as they look upon me to be a Spy and that I must be
obliged to give security or go to jail." Then to Leesburg again, which
he seems to regard as his American home and on the 28th October
sees a "General Muster of the County Militia in town, about 600
men appeared under-armed, with Tobacco sticks in general much
rioting and confusion. Recruiting Officers for the <i>Sleber</i> Army offer
Twelve Pounds bounty and 200 acres of land when the War is over,
but get very few men." In spite of repeatedly admonishing himself in
his journal to avoid political arguments he was unable to do so, particularly
when in his cups, and so on the 28th November his criticism
of the Revolution and its adherents caused him to be waited upon by
three members of the Committee of Safety who obliged him to
pledge himself not to leave the Colony for three months.</p>

<p>At this time there was an ordinary at Leesburg known as the
Crooked Billet.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> It was a favourite place for the heavy drinking
parties in which Cresswell and his friends indulged. He records, after
a night of debauchery, he had sent all his companions "to bed drunk
and I am now going to bed myself at 9 in the morning as drunk as an
honest man could wish." The next day the carouse continued. The
Leesburg of the eighteenth century was as little noted for sobriety
as were other parts of the English-speaking world.</p>

<p>After spending much of the winter of 1776-'7 in and around Leesburg
and recording the great encouragement the Americans obtained
from Washington's successes at Princeton and elsewhere, he,
on the 1st March, 1777, "went with Captn. Douglas and Mr.
Flemming Patterson to see Mr. Josiah Clapham. He is an Assembly
Man, Colonel of the county and Justice of the Peace on the present
establishment. He is an Englishman from Wakefield in Yorkshire,
much in debt at home, and in course a violent Sleber here. Has made
himself very popular by erecting a Manufactory of Guns, but it is
poorly carried on. His wife is the most notable woman in the County
for Housew'fery, but I should like her much better if she would
keep a cleaner house. He has got a very good plantation, takes every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
mean art to render himself popular amongst a set of ignorant Dutchmen
that are settled in his neighbourhood. Dirty in person and
principle."</p>

<p>Though much embarrassed by his poverty Cresswell refuses a
commission as a captain of Engineers at $3 per day offered to him by
Colonel Green and Colonel Grayson. He told them he "could not
bear the thoughts of taking up arms against my native country"
and they "were pleased to make me some genteel compliment about
my steadiness and resolution." His despondency returns and Mason
invites him to dinner and offers him "a letter of introduction and
recommendations to the Governor of Virginia by his permission to
go on board the man of war in the Bay." He resolves to accept the
letter and make an attempt to return to England in April. The Rev.
David Griffith returns to Leesburg and preaches "a political discourse."
He speaks of meeting Mr. Griffith and his wife at Mr.
Neilson's. Griffith, writes Cresswell "is a most violent Sleber. He
is Doctor and Chaplain to one of their Regmt." On the 22nd March,
1777, he records "Great tumults and murmurings among the
people caused by them pressing the young men into the Army. The
people now begin to feel the effects of an Independent Government
and groan under it, but cannot help themselves, as they are almost
in general disarmed."</p>

<p>On the 6th April, 1777, he left Leesburg and eventually succeeded
in getting to the British man-of-war <i>Phoenix</i> off the mouth
of the Chesapeake. After another visit to New York he finally
reached England in safety. In spite of all his tribulations and the
very real dangers he incurred in his American sojourn, he records that
"Virginia is the very finest country I ever was in"&mdash;no small concession.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>The people of Loudoun's German Settlement may have been "a
set of ignorant Dutchmen" to the irritated Cresswell but they
proved loyal and effective fighters in the American cause. They seem
to have been whole-heartedly with their Tidewater and Scotch-Irish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
neighbors in the controversy and are reputed to have largely joined
Armand's Legion under Charles Trefin Armand, Marquis de la
Rouaire (1751-1793) who, after service in the Garde de Corps in
Paris, had volunteered in the American Army on the 10th May,
1777, under the name of Charles Armand, had been commissioned
a colonel by the Congress, saw much service and was greatly beloved
by his men, few of whom were able to speak English.</p>

<p>Cresswell is confirmed in his statement regarding Clapham's gun
factory by the record of a session of the Committee of Safety of Virginia,
held on the 27th March, 1776, at Williamsburg:</p>

<p>"Ordered that a letter be written to Colonel Clapham in answer
to his of Feby 23rd and March 24th informing him that we have
sent him £360 to pay for the rifles mentioned by Chro. Perfect, that
the Comm'ee agree to take all the good musquets that shall be made
by the 5 or 6 hands he mentions by the 1st December next, and desire
him to contract for the 12 large rifles also mentioned."<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>Two other men in Loudoun must again be cited for their activities
in the cause of independence&mdash;one as a statesman, the other as a
soldier. Thomson Mason, from his ownership of Raspberry Plain,
was identified closely with the county although not a continuous
resident there. We find him constantly devoting his time and abilities
to the American cause. Even as early as 1774 he wrote</p>

<p>"You must draw your swords in a just cause, and rely upon that
God, who assists the righteous, to support your endeavours to preserve
the liberty he gave, and the love of which he hath implanted in
your hearts as essential to your nature."</p>

<p>Less eloquent but more active was Leven Powell. He with Mason,
in that same year of 1774, was urging his neighbors to resistance. In
1775 he received a commission as major in a battalion of Minute
Men from Loudoun, in 1777 was made by General Washington a
lieutenant colonel of the 16th Regiment of Virginia Continentals,
spent the greater part of that year in raising and equipping his command
and saw much active service until invalided home from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
vigours of the following terrible winter at Valley Forge. His impaired
health forced him to resign his commission in the autumn of
1778.</p>

<p>By way of sharp contrast to the other people of Loudoun, the
Quakers refused to aid or abet the Revolution in any way. Through
their industry and frugality they had, by that time, acquired some
influence in the County but when they refused to aid their fellow-Virginians
in the great struggle, all that was changed. Non-resistance
was a cardinal principle of their faith and come weal or woe they
stuck to it. They refused to serve in the army. They refused to pay
muster-fines. "Not even the scourge" writes Kercheval of the
Quakers of the Valley, "would compel them to submit to discipline.
The practice of coercion was therefore abandoned and the legislature
enacted a law to levy a tax upon their property to hire substitutes to
perform militia duty in their stead."<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Refusing to pay these taxes
their property was sold and many were reduced to great distress.
Others, taking advantage of these tax sales, bought up their properties
and profited largely by their shrewdness.</p>

<p>As the war continued, Virginia faced difficulties in raising her
quota of Continental troops. We have read Cresswell's record of
these troubles in Loudoun as early as October, 1776. In 1778 the
Assembly passed an act recognizing as inadequate prior laws on the
subject, calling for 2,216 men, rank and file, and offering for eighteen
months enlistment $300; while to those who enlisted for
three years, or the duration of the war, $400 was to be given "together
with the continental bounty of land and shall be entitled
to receive the pay and rations which are allowed to soldiers in the
continental army from the day of their enlistment and shall be
furnished annually, at the public expense with the following articles,
a coat, waistcoat and breeches, two shirts, one hat, two pairs of
stockings, one pair of shoes and a blanket...."<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> In the same year
the Legislature was obliged to pass an act against "forestallers and
engrossers"&mdash;in other words what we today call war profiteers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
authorizing the governor to seize grain and flour for the army in
the hands of those gentry.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>The objection to enlistment seems to have been directed against
the longer term rather than to military service itself. Also there was
confusion and lack of that complete authority necessary in such a
crisis. We find Colonel Josias Clapham writing to the Council of
Virginia on the 11th September, 1778, asking to be permitted to
send a company of volunteers, which had been raised in Loudoun,
to the assistance of General McIntosh's Brigade, but his request was
declined on the ground that the "Executive power" had no right to
send volunteers to join any corps whatsoever.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>The lot of the Loyalist or "Tories" as they were popularly termed,
was not a happy one. There was one James White who indiscreetly
"spoke many disrespectful words of his Excellency G. Washington
and that he was not fit to be the son of a Stewart dog." White appears
to have been indicted in Loudoun as a Tory and thereupon to
have fled the county. There is the suggestion that he was a man of
some property and that to avoid its confiscation he later saw the error
of his ways, returned to Loudoun, apologized to the court for his behavior,
took the oath of allegiance to the new State of Virginia and
so succeeded in having his indictment dismissed.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>At the other end of the social scale were the white convicts of
which, as we have seen, Loudoun had long had her share or more.
There has been preserved an advertisement of 1777 by Sam Love, a
justice of the peace:</p>

<p>"Ran away from the subscriber, in Loudoun County, two convict
servants, David Hinds, an Irishman, about 35 years of age, 5 feet, 6 or
8 inches high, pitted with small pox, hath a wart or pear on his chin,
hath short, black, curled hair, had on when he went away a country
cloth jacket and breeches, yarn stockings, country linen shirt, old
shoes and felt hat almost new,&mdash;George Dorman, born in England,
about 20 years of age, 5 feet, 6 or 7 inches hight, had on when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
went away nearly the same clothing as Hinds, they both had iron
collars on when they went away, its expected they will change their
clothing and have forged passes. Whoever brings the said servants
home shall have Two Dollars reward for each if taken ten miles from
home, and in proportion for a greater or less distance, as far as 50
miles, including what the law allows.</p>

<p>But negroes and convicts were not the only class in Loudoun deprived
of liberty. Early in 1776 the unfortunate prisoners of war
began to arrive. Of a number of "Highland Prisoners taken by Captain
James and Richard Barren in the Ship Oxford," the following
were sent to Loudoun by the Committee of Safety at its session on
the 24th June 1776:</p>

<p>The next year a much larger contingent made its appearance.
The Hessian prisoners taken at the Battle of Saratoga were divided
into parties which were sent to different parts of the Colonies. A
numerous band was sent to Noland's Ferry where a camp for them
was established and, it is said, some of their number were employed
in building the Noland mansion there, thus fixing the long disputed
date of its construction. Briscoe Goodhart says that few of
these prisoners were returned to Europe after the war but that, for
the most part, they settled in Loudoun and in Frederick and Montgomery
counties, Maryland, in all of which were many of German
descent and that the former Hessian prisoners became useful and industrious
citizens in their new homes.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>
<p>As the war drew to its close in 1781, there appears to have been a
large accumulation of war supplies in Loudoun. Lafayette wrote to
Washington on the 1st July of that year:</p>

<p>"There must be a great quantity of accoutrements in the country.
By a letter from the Board of War, I find that 100 Saddles, 100
Swords, 100 pairs of pistols may be soon expected at Leesburg, supposing
that the same number be got in the country...."<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>On the 26th of the same month Colonel William Davis, in covering
the situation in the Northern Neck, wrote</p>

<p>"At Noland's there are 920 muskets and 486 bayonets. Those
added to the 275 at Fredericksburg are too many by 195...."<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>And on the 9th August in the same year, Captain A. Bohannan
wrote from Fauquier Court House to Colonel Wm. Davis:</p>

<p>"I have this moment returned from Leesburg&mdash;the stores that
were there &amp; at Noland's Ferry are now on their way to this place;
it was with the greatest difficulty that I could procure waggons in
the neighbourhood of Leesburg for the Transportation of them; in
short I cou'd not have done it had I not promised to pay them when
they arrived at this place &amp; discharge them. It is useless to pretend to
impress waggons in this part of the Country, as you will seldom see
a waggon on any plantation but what wants either a wheel or Geer.
the Inhabitants say they are willing to work for the public, provided
that they cou'd get paid for their services. They are willing to
take what the Q. M. Genl: allows, tho' it shu'd be less than they
could get from private persons."</p>

<p>It was estimated that it would cost "Fifteen or Twenty Thousand
Pounds" (presumably tobacco) to move the stores, and the writer
"desires some pay for himself, being without a shilling and not having
received any money for eighteen months."<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>And now, a final glimpse of Loudoun and Leesburg in the Revolution,
afforded in the diary of Captain John Davis of the Pennsylvania
line who passed through the county with General Anthony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Wayne's Brigade on its way to Yorktown and victory; the entries to
be quoted begin on the 31st day of May, 1781, when the command
was on its way from "York Town" in Pennsylvania:</p>

<p>"Took up the line of march at sunrise, passed through Frederick
Town, Maryland and reached Powtomack, which, in crossing in
Squows, one unfortunately sunk, loaded with artillery &amp; Q. M.
stores and men in which our Sergeant &amp; three men were drowned;
encamped on the S. W. side of the river. Night being very wet, our
baggage not crossed, Officers of the Reg. took Quarters in Col. Clapham's
Negro Quarter, where we agreeably passed the night.</p>

<p>"June 1st. Continued on our ground till four o'clock in the afternoon,
when we mov'd five miles on the way to Leesburg.</p>

<p>"June 2d. Very wet day ... &amp; continued till evening.</p>

<p>"3rd (Loudoun Co.) Took up the line of March at 10 o'clock,
passed through Leesburg&mdash;the appearance of which I was much disappointed
in; encamped at Goose Creek, 15 miles.</p>

<p>"4th. (Prince Wm. Co.) Marched from Goose Creek at six
o'clock at which place left our baggage &amp; sick, and proceeded
through the low country. Roads bad in consequence of the rains;
encamped at Red house 18 miles."</p>

<p>All writers of the period who describe the town agree that Leesburg,
after twenty years or more of existence, was still a shabby
little place, "of few and insignificant wooden houses" as one traveller
records his impressions. The day of permanent buildings in the
town had not yet arrived. Hardly an edifice standing in Leesburg
today was then in existence.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>THE STORY OF JOHN CHAMPE</h3>


<p>While the Powells and the Masons, the Lees, the
Claphams, the Nolands and the Rusts, the Chinns, the
Peytons, the Mercers, the Ellzeys and others of her
natural leaders and large landowning families of the time, had
abetted and supported, in one capacity or another, the Revolutionary
cause, it was, in the end, the simple, homespun, backwoodsman class
that bred Loudoun's most romantic figure in the Revolution. Sergeant
Major John Champe of Lee's Partisan Legion, mighty of bone
and sinew, stout-hearted, resourceful and of such boundless devotion
and loyalty to his country and his commander-in-chief in its
hour of travail that he consented to incur the scorn and hatred of
his fellow-soldiers when along that hard path lay his duty, deserves
to have his fidelity, his courage and his exploits commemorated at
length in every story of his native county.</p>

<p>John Champe was born in what was soon to become Loudoun in
the year 1752. Little or nothing is known of his boyhood. His
family was too humble and his early life too obscure to have challenged
the pen of his scattered neighbors. When the American
Colonies revolted against the mother country, he at once enlisted in
Virginia's forces and in 1780 was serving as a dragoon in Light
Horse Harry Lee's cavalry Legion in which he had by sheer merit
attained the rank of sergeant major and, through the esteem he had
earned, was in line for promotion to a commission. The morale of
the American Army had been profoundly shaken by Arnold's recent
treason and escape; the courageous but unfortunate young British
officer Andrè was a prisoner in Washington's hands as a result of
his part in the affair and Washington was deeply troubled lest the
treason which had corrupted Arnold had spread its vicious poison
elsewhere among his soldiers. Henry Lee of Virginia, famous enough
in his own right but also destined to be known as the father of General
Robert E. Lee as well, was afterward, in the War of 1812, commissioned
a major general; but then, as a cavalry major of twenty-three
in command of an independent partisan corps of Dragoons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
had already achieved his magnificent capture of the British-held
fort at Paulus Hook and for that and many another daring exploit
enjoyed no small military distinction. At the time our story opens,
Lee and his corps were with Washington along the Hudson River.
Many years later he was to write his famous <i>Memoirs of the War in
the Southern Department of the United States</i>,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> an important source-book
of American history. It is to this work that we are principally
indebted for our knowledge of Champe's exploit and from it I shall
quote largely the story, condensing but the less essential parts. Only
thus can be taken the true measure of Champe's heroism, now too
generally forgotten in Loudoun.</p>

<p>There had fallen into Washington's hands certain anonymous
papers which appeared to involve other of his soldiers in treason, and
particularly one of his generals.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> He had sent for Lee and handed him
the papers. Lee studied them carefully and when asked his counsel,
said he thought they represented a contrivance of Sir Henry Clinton,
the British commander-in-chief, to destroy confidence between
Washington and his men and purposely had been permitted by the
British to fall into Washington's hands. Washington rejoined that
the idea was plausible and had already occurred to him; but the
danger involved in the possible defection of one of his highest officers
was so great that the truth must be ascertained at once.</p>

<p>"'I have sent for you'" Lee quotes Washington as saying, "'in
the expectation that you have in your corps individuals capable and
willing to undertake an indispensable, delicate and hazardous project.
Whoever comes forward upon this occasion, will lay me under
great obligations personally, and in behalf of the United States I will
reward him amply. No time is to be lost: he must proceed if possible
this night. My object is to probe to the bottom the afflicting intelligence
contained in the papers you have just read; to seize Arnold,
and by getting him, to save Andrè. They are all connected. While
my emissary is engaged in preparing means for the seizure of Arnold,
the guilt of others can be traced; and the timely delivery of Arnold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
to me, will possibly put it into my power to restore the amiable and
unfortunate Andrè to his friends. My instructions are ready, in
which you will find my express orders that Arnold is not to be hurt;
but that he be permitted to escape if to be prevented only by killing
him, as his public punishment is the sole object in view. That you
cannot too forcibly press upon whomsoever may engage in the
enterprise; and this fail not to do. With my instructions are two
letters to be delivered as ordered and here are some guineas for expenses.'</p>

<p>"Major Lee, replying, said that he had little or no doubt but that
his legion contained many individuals daring enough for any operation,
however perilous; but that the one in view required a combination
of qualities not easily to be found, unless in a commissioned
officer to whom he could not venture to propose an enterprise the
first step in which was desertion. That though the sergeant-major
of the cavalry was in all respects qualified for the delicate and adventurous
project, and to him it might be proposed without indelicacy,
as his station did not interpose an obstacle before stated; yet
it was very probable that the same difficulty would occur in his breast,
to remove which would not be easy, if practicable."</p>

<p>Washington became at once interested in this hitherto unknown
sergeant major and asked his name, his country, his age, size, length
of service and character.</p>

<p>"Being told his name," continues Lee "that he was a native of
Loudoun County in Virginia; about twenty-three or twenty-four
years of age&mdash;that he had enlisted in 1776&mdash;rather above the medium
size&mdash;full of bone and muscle; with a saturnine countenance, grave,
thoughtful and taciturn&mdash;of tried courage and inflexible perseverance,
and as likely to regret an adventure coupled with ignominy as any
officer in the corps; a commission being the goal of his long and
anxious exertions, and certain on the first vacancy&mdash;the general exclaimed
that he was the very man for the business; and that going
to the enemy by the instigation and at the request of his officer, was
not desertion though it appeared to be so. And he enjoined that this
explanation, as coming from him, should be pressed on Champe."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>Leaving Washington, Lee hastened to the camp of his cavalry
corps where, arriving about 8:00 o'clock at night, he sent for
Champe and placed the matter before him, stressing "the very great
obligation he would confer on the commander-in-chief" and all else
Lee could think of to insure his acceptance of the assignment; concluding
with an explanation of the details of the plan, so far as they
had been developed, and an expression of his personal wish that he
would enter upon its execution instantly.</p>

<p>"Champe listened with deep attention, and with a highly excited
countenance; the perturbations of his breast not being hid even by
his dark visage. He briefly and modestly replied, that no soldier exceeded
him in respect and affection for the commander-in-chief, to
serve whom he would willingly lay down his life; and that he was
sensible of the honour conferred by the choice of him for the execution
of a project all over arduous; nor could he be at a loss to know to
whom was to be ascribed the preference bestowed, which he took
pleasure in acknowledging, although increasing obligations, before
great and many."</p>

<p>As for the plan itself, Champe thought it excellent and understood
at once how great might be the benefits resulting from its
success. "He was not deterred by the danger and difficulty which
was evidently to be encountered but he was deterred by the ignominy
of desertion, to be followed by the hypocrisy of enlisting with the
enemy; neither of which comported with his feelings, and either
placed an insuperable bar in his way to promotion. He concluded
by observing, that if any mode could be contrived free from disgrace,
he would cordially embark in the enterprise. As it was he prayed to
be excused."</p>

<p>Thus Champe's reaction to the project justified Lee's prior opinion
expressed to his general and shewed his knowledge and understanding
of the man. But the plan, with the tremendous results involved,
pressed for immediate action and Lee exerted his utmost power of
persuasion. He pointed out that Washington himself had declared
that, in this case, the desertion was not a crime; adding that if
Champe accepted, Lee would consider the whole corps highly honored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
by the General's call but that if it failed, at such a critical moment,
to furnish a competent man it would reduce Lee to "a mortifying
condition."</p>

<p>It was a long and arduous task to overcome Champe's repugnance
to become involved, even seemingly, in a situation repellant to his
every standard of honor to which his soldier's life had been trained;
but slowly Lee overcame his scruples and obtained his consent. Then
the detailed instructions, already prepared, were read to him, covering
not only his behaviour and procedure when once safely away
but also the very difficult matter of the desertion itself which must
be so managed as to leave no doubt in his companions' minds as to
his treachery but also to insure, so far as possible, his safety from
their inevitable wrath. Obviously very little help could be given by
Major Lee at this point "lest it might induce a belief that he was
privy to the desertion, which opinion getting to the enemy would
involve the life of Champe." So that part of the matter was left to
the young sergeant, Lee promising, however, that if his escape were
discovered before morning, he would seek to delay the pursuit "as
long as practical."</p>

<p>Giving Champe three guineas as initial expense money, Lee urged
him to start without delay and to let him hear from him, as promptly
as possible, after he had arrived in New York. Champe, again urging
Lee to delay pursuit, returned to his camp "and taking his cloak,
valise and orderly book, he drew his horse from the picket and
mounting him, put himself upon fortune."</p>

<p>His anticipation of rapid discovery and pursuit proved only too
well founded. None knew better than he the alertness and efficiency
of his fellow-dragoons and the effective discipline maintained in
Lee's command. Less than half an hour had passed since he escaped
the camp, before his absence, under what appeared highly suspicious
circumstances, was discovered and promptly reported. "Captain
Carnes, Officer of the day, waited upon the Major<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> and with considerable
emotion told him that one of the patrol had fallen in with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
a dragoon, who being challenged, put spur to his horse and escaped,
though instantly pursued."</p>

<p>Lee, mindful of the value to Champe of every minute of delay
which his ingenuity could devise, simulated a lack of understanding
of his report, and when that had been repeated and clarified, appeared
to doubt Carnes' deduction and sought to persuade him that
he was mistaken. The latter, however, was a competent officer and
moreover his suspicions had been thoroughly aroused. Arnold's
treason had raised mistrust of loyalty which, perhaps, normally
would not have been entertained. Therefore on leaving Lee, Carnes
at once returned to his men and ordered them to assemble, thus
quickly learning that Champe, "his horse, baggage, arms and
orderly book" were missing. His worst fears thus confirmed and,
greatly affected by the supposed desertion in his own command, he
hurriedly arranged a party for pursuit and returned to Lee for written
orders. Again Lee played for delay. While appearing to approve of
Carnes' zeal, he told him that he had already planned certain other
and particular service for him that night and that another officer
would have to lead the pursuit. For that purpose, after apparent deep
and protracted consideration, he chose a younger officer, Cornet
Middleton, being moved to do so, writes Lee by "his knowledge of
the tenderness of Middleton's disposition, which he hoped would
lead to the protection of Champe, should he be taken;" but he was,
at the end, obliged to issue orders in the customary form upon such
occasions and those delivered to Middleton, duly signed by Lee, read
ominously enough: "Pursue as far as you can with safety Sergeant
Champe, who is suspected of deserting to the enemy, and has taken
the road leading to Paulus Hook. Bring him alive that he may suffer
in the presence of the army; but kill him if he resists or escapes after
being taken."</p>

<p>And still Lee procrastinated. With one device or another he contrived
to hold Middleton, giving him instructions in such detail that
they bordered on the trivial. Yet rake his imagination as he would,
he at length was obliged to dismiss the youthful Cornet, with an
expressed wish, however insincere, for his success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>In the meanwhile, and soon after Champe's departure, rain had
begun to fall, almost wrecking the carefully contrived plan; for
Champe's horse was shod in a manner peculiar to the Legion and
Middleton's party was thus better able to follow Champe's course
than otherwise would have been possible on a dark night through the
deserted country. Middleton and his men had finally succeeded in
leaving the American camp soon after midnight, something over an
hour after Champe had made his escape; but to examine the ground
for shoeprints and the prints themselves, on a rainy night, meant the
frequent dismounting of troopers, the striking of a light and thus an
ever-growing delay. With the break of day, however, the shoeprints
were clear enough and better time could be made&mdash;and then on a rise
before reaching Three Pigeons, some miles north of the Village of
Bergen, Middleton's men caught sight of the fugitive, not more
than half a mile ahead, Champe seeing his pursuers at the same time.</p>

<p>The pursuit was now so grimly close that Champe knew a mistake
by him or taking any but the most essential risks meant quick capture
and no gentle treatment, if, indeed, he should survive that unpleasant
event. Therefore he quickly abandoned his first plan to
reach Paulus Hook (now part of Jersey City) and instead, with all
possible speed and by changing his course, sought immediate refuge
in the British galleys which he knew lay a few miles to the west of
Bergen "in accordance with British custom." Again, on the new
course, he was sighted, his determined pursuers coming within two
or three hundred yards of their quarry; but Champe, coming abreast
of the galleys "dismounted and running through the marsh to the
river, plunged into it, calling upon the galleys for help." This was
readily given; "they fired upon our horse" writes Lee "and sent a boat
to meet Champe, who was taken in and carried on board, and conveyed
to New York with a letter from the captain of the galley,
stating the circumstances he had seen." Escape had been achieved
by the narrowest of margins and in the gravest danger; but it had
created a realistic background for Champe's introduction to the
British, difficult indeed to have bettered. Not the slightest doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
was entertained by either group that it had witnessed a daring desertion
most narrowly achieved.</p>

<p>Greatly chagrined as were the Americans, they were not obliged
to return entirely empty-handed. The fleeing Sergeant's horse with
its equipment, his cloak and scabbard fell into their hands and were
carried back by them; but Champe held onto his sword until he
plunged into the river and the British made it too hot at that point
for prolonged search. Dejectedly the dragoons returned to their
camp to report their failure; giving Lee, quite unknowingly, a very
bad moment when he saw Champe's riderless horse being led back,
until he was apprised of what had really happened; thereupon he
lost no time in presenting himself to General Washington and reporting
the complete success of the first part of the hazardous adventure.</p>

<p>Four days slowly passed, and then an unsigned letter, in a disguised
hand, was received by Lee from his sergeant, telling of his
further adventures. He had, it seems, been kindly received on the
galley and taken at once to the British Commandant in New York
who was deeply interested in his story of his escape. The keen-witted
Champe did not fail to take full advantage of his sympathetic audience
and the good impression he was making. He assured the British
officers "that such was the spirit of defection which prevailed among
the American troops in consequence of Arnold's example, that he
had no doubt, if the temper was properly cherished, Washington's
ranks would not only be greatly thinned, but that some of his best
corps would leave him." This did not seem, to a reflective mind,
wholly consistent with the fire and spirit of the pursuit which the
sergeant had so narrowly eluded, but his circumstantial narrative
gave such welcome news to the British that they appear happily to
have succumbed to the very human inclination to believe what they
most wished were true. Their enthusiasm, however, did not cause
them to forego recording a very careful description of their new
ally: "his size, place of birth, form, countenance, hair, the corps in
which he had served, with other remarks in conformity with the
British usage." Delighted as were his new friends with the sergeant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and his story and inclined to accept both as offered, they apparently
had not wholly failed to profit from their long contact at home with
their canny northern neighbors.</p>

<p>And now Champe was taken before His Majesty's Commander-in-Chief,
Sir Henry Clinton himself. Nothing was wanting to shew
the importance attached by the British to this latest deserter and the
causes believed by them to have impelled him to his course. Clinton
closely cross-examined the fugitive as to the possibility of the encouragement
of further desertions from the American forces, the
effect of Arnold's treason on Washington and the treatment being
given Andrè. Although there were moments when Champe's ingenuity
and presence of mind appear to have been sadly taxed, yet
on the whole he succeeded in so well and convincingly deporting
himself that Sir Henry, at the close of his examination, gave him a
couple of guineas and assigned him to the service of General Arnold,
with a letter telling the latter who and what he was. Arnold also received
Champe cordially, expressed much satisfaction on hearing
from him the manner of his escape and the fabulous effect of
Arnold's example; and concluded his numerous enquiries by assigning
to him similar quarters to those occupied by his own recruiting
sergeants.</p>

<p>Nothing could have developed more favorably to the American's
plot. Of a surety, fickle fortune appeared at last to be broadly smiling
on him.</p>

<p>Arnold's next move was to seek to persuade Champe to join his
legion; but that was a step so repugnant to the sergeant's spirit that
even devotion to Washington failed, in his mind, to justify it; so he
told Arnold, with some surliness, that for his part, he had had
enough of war and knew that if he ever were captured by the rebels
he would be hung out-of-hand which for him made further military
service doubly hazardous.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Arnold had reason to appreciate the sergeant's
point and permitted him to retire to his quarters where at
once he devoted himself to the consideration of how and when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
could make contact with the American friends within the British
lines who were to get for him the information sought by Washington
as to the loyalty of certain of his officers. This contact, with fortune's
aid, he was able to establish the next night and his new friend
not only pledged himself to procure the information he sought but
engaged to send out Champe's reports to Major Lee as well.</p>

<p>Thus was communication established between Champe and Lee
and promptly word came from the latter urging expedition; for
Andrè's situation had become desperate and further delay by Washington
increasingly difficult. And then Andrè himself destroyed his
own last chance and ruined the hopes and efforts of his well-wishers.
Disdaining pretense or defense, he freely acknowledged the truth of
the charges against him and sealed his own doom. By his acknowledgment
Washington's hands were tied and Andrè was promptly
condemned as a spy and duly executed.</p>

<p>Andrè's tragic fate did not diminish Washington's desire to lay
his hands on Arnold. Champe was duly informed by Lee of the fatal
event and again urged to bring the plot in which he was engaged to
a successful outcome.</p>

<p>But Champe needed no urging. With such alacrity had he and his
confederates been working, that soon he was able to send a report to
Lee completely vindicating the American general officer toward
whom Washington's doubts had been directed, which report Lee
duly transmitted to his chief; with the result that "the distrust
heretofore entertained of the accused was forever dismissed."</p>

<p>And now Champe had but to secure the person of Arnold to
crown his task with success and to wholly justify the confidence reposed
in him by Lee and Washington. On the 19th October, 1780,
Major Lee received from him a full report of his progress toward
that end and the plan he had made. Again Lee laid his communication
before his general, from whom he received the following
letter in Washington's own handwriting, shewing how carefully
the latter sought to guard the secret and protect his emissary:</p>

<div class="signature">
"Headquarters October 20, 1780

<p>"Dear Sir: The plan proposed for taking A&mdash;&mdash;d (the outlines of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
which are communicated in your letter, which was this moment put
into my hands without date) has every mark of a good one. I therefore
agree to the promised rewards; and have such entire confidence
in your management of the business, as to give it my fullest approbation;
and leave the whole to the guidance of your judgment, with
this express stipulation and pointed injunction, that he (A&mdash;&mdash;d) is
to be brought to me alive.</p>

<p>"No circumstance whatever shall obtain my consent to his being
put to death. The idea which would accompany such an event,
would be that ruffians had been hired to assassinate him. My aim is
to make a public example of him; and this should be strongly impressed
upon those who are employed to bring him off. The Sergeant
must be very circumspect&mdash;too much zeal may create suspicion, and
too much precipitency may defeat the project. The most inviolable
secrecy must be observed on all hands. I send you five guineas; but I
am not satisfied of the propriety of the Sergeant's appearing with
much specie. This circumstance may also lead to suspicion, as it is

<p>Written communications between Champe and Lee continued.
In ten days Champe had added the final touches to his plan for the
abduction and so informed Lee, asking that on the third subsequent
night a party of dragoons meet him at Hoboken to whom he hoped
to deliver Arnold.</p>

<p>Our sergeant was by this time familiar with Arnold's habits and
movements. He knew that it was Arnold's custom to return to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
home about midnight and to visit the garden before retiring. It was
at that time that Champe and the allies he, through Lee's letters,
had obtained, planned to seize and gag the renegade and remove him
by way of an adjoining alley to a boat, manned by other trusted conspirators,
at one of the wharves on the nearby Hudson.</p>

<p>When the appointed day arrived, Washington directed Lee to
himself take command of the small detachment of dragoons who
were to meet Champe and his prisoner. "The day arrived," quoting
Lee again "and Lee with a party of dragoons left camp late in the
evening, with three led horses; one for Arnold, one for the sergeant
and the third for his associate; never doubting the success of the enterprise
from the tenor of the last received communication. The party
reached Hoboken about midnight, where they were concealed in the
adjoining wood&mdash;Lee with three dragoons stationing himself near the
river shore. Hour after hour passed&mdash;no boat approached. At length
the day broke and the major retired to his party and with his led
horses returned to camp, where he proceeded to headquarters to inform
the general of the disappointment as mortifying as inexplicable."</p>

<p>Deeply concerned as were both Washington and Lee over the failure
of the plan, they were also very apprehensive as to Champe's
fate, but in a few days one of the sergeant's associates succeeded in
getting through to them an anonymous letter explaining the failure
of their plans. On the day preceding that fixed for the abduction,
Arnold most unexpectedly removed his quarters to another part of
the town to facilitate the supervision by him of the embarkation of
troops on a special mission to be commanded by him and wholly unforeseen
by the conspirators&mdash;an expeditionary force made up largely
of American deserters. "Thus it happened" Lee explains "that John
Champe, instead of crossing the Hudson that night, was safely deposited
on board one of the fleet of transports, from whence he never
departed until Arnold landed in Virginia! Nor was he able to escape
from the British Army until after the junction of Lord Cornwallis at
Petersburg, when he deserted; and proceeding high up into Virginia,
he passed into North Carolina near the Saura towns, and keeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
in the friendly districts of that State, safely joined the army soon
after it had passed the Congaree in pursuit of Lord Rawdon.</p>

<p>"His appearance excited extreme surprise among his former comrades,
which was not a little increased when they saw the cordial reception
he met with from Lieutenant Colonel Lee. His whole story
soon became known to the corps, which reproduced the love and
respect of officer and soldier, heightened by universal admiration of
his daring and arduous attempt.</p>

<p>"Champe was introduced to General Green, who cheerfully complied
with the promises made by the commander-in-chief, so far as
in his power; and having provided the sergeant with a good horse
and money for his journey, sent him to General Washington, who
munificently anticipated every desire of the sergeant, and presented
him with a discharge from further service lest he might in the vicissitudes
of war, fall into the enemy's hands, when if recognized, he
was sure to die on a gibbet."</p>

<p>Here ends Lee's account, apparently as first written; but subsequently
he seems to have acquired some further information of his
sergeant's later life which he appends in a note, as will appear later.</p>

<p>When Champe was with the British in New York, he, according
to Lee and as appears above, refused to enlist in the enemy's forces;
but there is another account which says that when he arrived in
New York "he was placed in the company of Captain Cameron."
In the Champe family is the tradition that he wrote to Lee of this:</p>

<p>"I was yesterday compelled to a most affecting step, but one indispensable
the success of my plan. It was necessary for me to accept a
commission in the traitor's legion that I might have uninterrupted
access to his house."</p>

<p>This Captain Cameron, after the termination of the war, married
in Virginia and fortunately kept a diary, a part of which was published
in <i>The British United Service Journal</i>. From it we learn,
through Howe,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> that Cameron had occasion to traverse the forests of
Loudoun with a single servant and&mdash;familiar touch&mdash;was caught in
one of those violent thunderstorms so characteristic of upper Piedmont.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Night came on, no habitation or shelter of any kind was discernible
to our travellers in that wilderness and, believing themselves
in grave peril, they were becoming really alarmed when they saw
through the woods a faint light. Riding toward it, they discovered it
came from one of the typical log-houses of a frontier clearing and
they lost no time in seeking shelter. The owner of the little home
received them with true backwoods hospitality. And now quoting
from Captain Cameron's journal:</p>

<p>"He would not permit either master or man to think of their
horses, but insisted that we should enter the house, where fire and
changes of apparel awaited us, he himself led the jaded animals to a
shed, rubbed them down and provided them with forage. It would
have been affectation of the worst kind to dispute his pleasure in
this instance, so I readily sought the shelter of his roof, to which a
comely dame bade me welcome, and busied herself in preventing my
wishes. My drenched uniform was exchanged for a suit of my host's
apparel; my servant was accomodated in the same manner, and we
soon afterwards found ourselves seated before a blazing fire of wood,
by the light of which our hostess assiduously laid out a well-stocked
supper table. I need not say that all this was in the highest degree
comfortable. Yet I was not destined to sit down to supper without
discovering still greater cause for wonder. In due time our host returned
and the first glance which I cast towards him satisfied me
that he was no stranger. The second set everything like doubt at
rest. Sergeant Champe stood before me; the same in complexion, in
feature, though somewhat less thoughtful in the expression of his
eye, as when he first joined my company in New York.</p>

<p>"I cannot say my sensations on recognizing my ci-devant sergeant
were altogether agreeable. The mysterious manner in which he both
came and went, the success with which he had thrown a veil over
his own movements, and the recollection that I was the guest of a
man who probably entertained no sense of honour, either public or
private, excited in me a vague and indefinite alarm, which I found it
impossible on the instant to conceal. I started, and the movement
was not lost upon Champe. He examined my face closely; and a light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
appearing to burst all at once upon his memory, he ran forward
toward the spot where I sat.</p>

<p>"'Welcome, welcome, Captain Cameron' said he 'a thousand
times welcome to my roof; you behaved well to me when I was under
your command, and deserve more of hospitality than I possess the
power to offer; but what I do possess is very much at your service,
and heartily glad am I that accident should have thus brought us together
again. You have doubtless looked upon me as a twofold
traitor, and I cannot blame you if you have. Yet I should wish to
stand well in your estimation too; and therefore I will, if you please,
give a faithful narrative of the causes which led both to my arrival in
New York, and to my abandonment of the British Army on the
shores of the Chesapeake. You are tired with your day's travel; you
stand in need of food and rest. Eat and drink, I pray you, and sleep
soundly; and tomorrow, if you are so disposed, I will try to put my
character straight in the estimation of the only British officer of
whose good opinion I am covetous.'</p>

<p>"There was so much frankness and apparent sincerity in this,
that I could not resist it, so I sat down to supper with a mind perfectly
at ease and having eaten heartily I soon afterwards retired to
rest, on a clean pallet which was spread for me on the floor. Sleep was
not slow in visiting my eyelids; nor did I awake until long after the
sun had risen on the morrow, and the hardy and active settlers, to
whose kindness I was indebted, had gone through a considerable
portion of their day's labour.</p>

<p>"I found my host next morning the same open, candid and hospitable
man that he had shewn himself on first recognizing me. He
made no allusion, indeed, during breakfast, to what had fallen from
him over night; but when he heard me talk of getting my horses
ready, he begged to have a few minutes' conversation with me. His
wife, for such my hostess was, immediately withdrew, under the pretext
of attending to her household affairs, upon which he took a seat
beside me and began his story."</p>



<p>After the war and, it is said, on the personal recommendation of
General Washington, Sergeant Champe was appointed to the position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
of doorkeeper or sergeant-at-arms of the Continental Congress,
then meeting at Philadelphia, but obliged, on account of rioting, to
remove to Trenton. His name appears on a roll of the 25th August,
1783, as holding that position. Soon afterwards he returned to
Loudoun, married and acquired a small holding near what is now
Dover, between the later towns of Aldie and Middleburg, close by
the present Little River Turnpike. The State of Virginia has erected
one of its excellent road markers adjacent to the spot, bearing the
following words:</p>

<div class="center">
"A Revolutionary Hero
</div>

<p>"Here stood the home of John Champ, Continental soldier. Champ
deserted and enlisted in Benedict Arnold's British Command for the
purpose of capturing the traitor, 1780. Failing in this attempt
Champ rejoined the American Army."</p>

<p>Nearby there is a pool of water still known locally as "Champe's
Spring."</p>

<p>According to local tradition, he later lived in a log cabin on the
old Military Road near the old Ketoctin Baptist Church and on
lands afterward owned by Robert Braden. Thence he in turn moved
to Kentucky where, it is believed he died in or about the year 1797.</p>

<p>And now we may return to General Lee's narrative for the note
he appended thereto:</p>

<p>"When General Washington was called by President Adams to
the command of the Army prepared to defend the country from
French hostility, he sent to Lieutenant-Colonel Lee to inquire for
Champe, being determined to bring him into the field at the head
of a company of infantry. Lee sent to Loudoun County, where
Champe settled after his discharge from the Army, and learned that
the gallant soldier had removed to Kentucky, and had soon after
died."</p>

<p>Of the sergeant's children, one son, Nathaniel, was born in Virginia
on the 22nd December, 1792, and in 1812 enlisted in Colonel
Duncan McArthur's regiment at Dayton, Ohio, that command
comprising a part of Hull's Army sent for the relief of Detroit. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
was in the battle of Monguagon, was among those captured at Detroit
and subsequently, in the regular army, saw further fighting
and was with General Arthur's advance-guard when Detroit was
reoccupied. After the war he engaged in business in Detroit, was a
buyer and seller of real estate and built Detroit's first "Temperance
Hotel" of which he acted as landlord and in which he was succeeded
by his son William. Later he moved to Onondago, Ohio, where he
died on the 13th February, 1870.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>EARLY FEDERAL PERIOD</h3>


<p>From the close of the Revolution to the War of 1812,
there were at least four outstanding movements in Loudoun:
the restoration of the fertility of her soil, the disestablishment
of the church, the loss of a substantial part of her area which returned
to Fairfax and the erection of large country mansions. The
great project of Washington's Potomac Company, involving the
extensive improvement of that river for navigation, was not, of course
a Loudoun enterprise, although the welfare of her people was greatly
affected and such Loudoun men as Joseph Janney, Benjamin Shreve,
John Hough, Benjamin Dulaney, William Brown, John Harper,
William Ellzey, and Leven Powell were at one time or another, as
directors or stockholders, interested in the undertaking.</p>

<p>In the settlement of county, the Virginians from Tidewater had
brought with them their improvident methods of farming. From the
earliest days, when land was more available than labor, scant attention
had been given by the Virginia planter or farmer to the conservation
or restoration of the fertility of his soil. A field was planted
and replanted to heavy-feeding crops, with perhaps an occasional
fallow year intervening; and when the inevitable result registered
itself in the falling off of production to a point where the planting of
that field became unprofitable, it was abandoned and new ground
broken up to be put through the same disastrous course. Rotation of
crops and the manuring of the land were seldom, if ever, practiced
outside perhaps the Quaker and German Settlements. Toward the
end of the eighteenth century, so far had this reckless agriculture
gone, that even the fertile lands of the Piedmont were recording the
result in no uncertain manner. The yield of corn and wheat to the
acre had been steadily declining, followed by an emigration of many
of the Loudoun people to Kentucky and elsewhere. It was then that
there arose in the county a farmer and leader who, measured by the
results of his work, may be considered as the most valuable man to
her own interests that Loudoun has thus far produced. John Alexander
Binns was the son of Charles Binns, the first clerk of Loudoun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
and of his wife, Ann Alexander, a daughter of "John Alexander the
Eldest of Stafford County. Gent." as he is described in a deed to his
daughter in 1760. The son was born probably about 1761, although
the exact date seems uncertain. In March, 1781, he was, as we have
seen, recommended by the County Court of Loudoun to the governor
for appointment as a first lieutenant in the Virginia forces and
at the same time his brother, Charles Binns, Jr., later to succeed his
father as county clerk, was recommended for a commission as second
lieutenant. After the war, John Binns turned his attention to farming
and grappled with the problem of restoring the fertility of the
soil. He had learned of the use of land plaster (gypsum) and clover
for that purpose in the Philadelphia neighborhood, whence it is said
the system had been brought from Leipsic in Saxony. As early as
1780 he began his experiments, using not only the land plaster and
clover but practicing deeper ploughing and rotating crops. At first
he was, of course, ridiculed by his farmer neighbors, for the reluctance
of the husbandman to change his methods is an old, old story.
But Binns persisted. As he improved one farm and his profits rose,
he purchased other worn-out lands from their discouraged owners
and in time was profiting handsomely from his intelligence and industry.
At length, in 1803, his labors crowned with success and the
agricultural wealth of his home county rapidly rising as a result of
his long and patient work, he sat himself down to write the story
of what he had accomplished. His little book was printed in a very
small edition, due probably to the high price and scarcity of paper,
and was offered for sale at fifty cents, under the comprehensive title
"<i>A Treatise on Practical Farming, embracing particularly the following
subjects, viz. The Use of Plaster of Paris, with Directions for
Using it; and General Observations on the Use of Other Manures.
On Deep Ploughing; thick Sowing of Grain; Method of Preventing
Fruit Trees from Decaying and Farming in General.</i> By John A.
Binns Of Loudoun County, Virginia, Farmer." It was published at
"Frederick-Town, Maryland," and "Printed by John B. Colvin,
Editor of the <i>Republican Advocate</i>, 1803." "The little book" writes
Rodney H. True "is now hard to find and the first edition, but for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the copy preserved by Jefferson and now treasured among the great
man's books in the Library of Congress, would well-nigh be lost."</p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson, with his restless intelligence, was one of the
first to acquire the book. Having studied it and being impressed with
Binns' success, he wrote to Sir John Sinclair, the head of the English
Board of Agriculture, a letter dated the 30th June, 1803, sending
with it</p>

<p>"the enclosed pamphlet on the use of gypsum by a Mr. Binns, a
plain farmer, who understands handling his plough better than his
pen. he is certainly something of an enthusiast in the use of this
manure; but he has a right to be so. the result of his husbandry
prooves his confidence in it well found for from being poor, it has
made him rich. the county of Loudoun in which he live(s) exhausted
&amp; wasted by bad husbandry, has, from his example, become
the most productive one in Virginia: and its lands, from being the
lowest, sell at the highest prices. these facts speak more strongly for
his pamphlet than a better arrangement &amp; more polished phrases
would have done. were I now a farmer I should surely adopt the
gypsum...."</p>

<p>On the same day, in a letter to Mr. William Strictland, another
member of the English Board of Agriculture, Jefferson wrote</p>

<p>"You will discover that Mr. Binns is an enthusiast for the use of
gypsum, but there are two facts which prove that he has a right to
be so 1. he began poor and has made himself tollerably rich by his
farming alone. 2. the county of Loudoun, in which he lives, had
been so exhausted &amp; wasted by bad husbandry, that it began to depopulate,
the inhabitants going Southwardly in quest of better lands.
Binns' success has stopped that immigration. it is now becoming
on(e) of the most productive counties of the state of Virginia, and
the price given for the lands is multiplied manifold."</p>

<p>Sir John Sinclair in his reply to Mr. Jefferson, whom he addresses
as "His Highness, Thomas Jefferson" wrote from Edinburgh under
date of the 1st January 1804:</p>

<p>"On various accounts I received with much pleasure, your obliging
letter of the 30th June last, which only reached me, at the place, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the 19th November. I certainly feel highly indebted to Mr. Binns,
both for the information contained in the pamphlet he has drawn
up; and also, for his having been the means of inducing you to recommence
our correspondence together, for the purpose of transmitting
a paper which does credit to the practical farmers of America.</p>

<p>"As to the Plaster of Paris, which Mr. Binns so strongly recommends,
it is singularly, that whilst it proves such a source of fertility
to you, it is of little avail in any part of the British Islands, Kent
alone excepted. I am thence inclined to conjecture, that its great advantage
must arise from its attracting moisture from the atmosphere,
of which we have in great abundance in these Kingdoms...."</p>

<p>But it is time to turn to Binns' own record of his work. How
desperately poor the yield of grain had become in Loudoun is shown
by his statement that some of his unplastered land yielded but five
bushels of wheat to the acre and not more than three bushels of corn
on a place so worn out, when he took it over in 1793, that his friends
thought he "must starve on it." By 1798 he was getting from that
farm 15<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> bushels of corn to the acre and the next year, on that
corn land, had 27 bushels of heavy wheat per acre. In another place
he notes: "I put a parcel of it" (plaster) "on some corn in the hill
which produced about 22 bushels, the other part of the field yielding
about 12 bushels to the acre."</p>

<p>As an interesting sidelight he indicates that tobacco was being
grown around Leesburg at that time. In 1803, as he wrote his book,
he expected a crop of 40 bushels of wheat per acre on his farms. And
by way of summarizing his work</p>

<p>"There are several places on the Catocton Mountain, that some
few years past the corn stalks, when the tops were taken off, were
not above three feet high, and which would not produce more than
two or three barrels of corn to the acre, and from 5 to 6 bushels of
wheat; and perhaps not yield grass enough to the acre to feed a horse
for two weeks after the harvest was taken off; but from the use of
plaster will now produce from six to eight barrels of corn, and from
twenty to twenty-five bushels of wheat per acre; the luxuriant
growth of the white and red clover after harvest gives the fields<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
which once looked like a barren waste of country, the appearance of a
beautiful meadow."</p>

<p>And upon sanitation he has this to say:</p>

<p>"... These circumstances made me anxious to cleanse
my stables, stockyards, cow-pens, hog-pens, wood-yards and ash-heaps
by the first June. This rule I have always followed ever since
I began to farm for myself, and can say that my family have never
experienced an intermittent or remittent" (fever) "unless attacked
with them from home first, and upon their return they have immediately
left them. In my travels where ever I have discovered those
kind of fevers, I have always observed either dirty, filthy stables,
hog-pens or water standing in their cellars or ponds of water not far
off; I have also observed those places most liable to dysentaries...."</p>

<p>In contrast to present-day views, he was wholly opposed to growing
rye on Loudoun lands, believing that it impoverished the soil and
that wheat yielded more in bushels; that rye destroyed grass and
clover and injured orchards. He approved the growing of wheat and
oats in orchards to maturity and strongly recommended the use of
plaster in them.</p>

<p>The result of Binns' work was acclaimed throughout Virginia.
His methods became known as the "Loudoun system" and the term
became as significant and popularly familiar as the "Norfolk system"
of farming in England. Of his work and his book True says:</p>

<p>"In spite of the fact that 'it is not written in a scholastic style,'
few books have been written in which more sound practical agriculture
is crowded into so small a space. Binns' chapter on the life history
of the Hessian fly stands as a piece of careful observation that
might have done credit to Dr. Thomas Say himself. The three fundamental
supports on which agriculture prosperity in Loudoun
County rests were never more clearly or soundly appreciated: gypsum,
clover and deep plowing. This was the background of the
famous 'Loudoun System' which came to be recognized as the progressive
practice for that part of the country a hundred years ago."<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>
<p>Binns died in 1813. His will, dated the 11th January in that year,
was offered for probate on the 1st November following. In it he
makes provision for freeing his slaves after a certain period. As he
left his estate to his wife and nieces, it is surmised that no children
survived him. The family, however, is still represented in Loudoun.
Captain John A. Tebbs, U.S.M.C., is a descendant of Charles
Binns, Jr., the younger brother of our agronomist.</p>

<p>It is difficult to escape the conclusion that religious thought and
observance were at a low ebb in Virginia in the latter part of the
eighteenth century. It was an age of transition, in some respects not
unlike that of today. Old ties were being broken, tradition and old-time
loyalties no longer received their former adherence. No small
responsibility attaches to that negligent and selfish minority of the
clergy of the colonial church and to an equally reprehensible element
in the early Federal days for remissness in their duties; and their
culpable behavior tends to attract more attention than the loyal devotion
of the majority of their brethren. It was inevitable that the
established church should be regarded as a part of the repudiated
British government and when its civil powers and ecclesiastical predominance
were taken from it and much of its property ruthlessly
confiscated, there ensued a period of confusion in religious matters,
with an unfortunate colouring of vindictive animosity on the part
of other communions. Concurrently the spread of Methodism took
from the older church many of its erstwhile adherents. Indeed, for
a disconcertingly long period after its "erection" in 1758, Leesburg
appears to have had no building devoted to religious purposes, services,
when held, having been at the courthouse. Cresswell, in his
journal, confirms this as does the first Shelburne Vestry book and
also an advertisement in Leesburg's '<i>True American</i>' of the 30th
December, 1800: "The Reverend Mr. Allen" it reads "intends to
perform divine service in the Court House, on the 4th January, at
half past eleven o'clock; he also proposes preaching every fortnight
from that date." This situation was repaired between 1780 and 1785,
when the Methodists, organized as a separate denomination in 1784,
erected their stone church on Cornwall Street with galleries around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
three of its sides and with its interesting old-fashioned sounding
board, which church came to be endowed with many associations
until its needless destruction about 1901. Then, in 1804, the "Presbyterian
Society of Leesburg," which had probably existed since
1782, was more formally organized as a church by the Rev. James
Hall, D.D., of Concord, North Carolina, at that time the Moderator
of the Presbyterian General Assembly. The erection of the
present quaint old brick church on Market Street, the oldest church
building now standing in Leesburg, had already been begun in 1802
and was completed in 1804. It was dedicated in May, 1804, by Dr.
Hall. Its first pastor was the Rev. John Mines, who served until
1822 and the first Elders were Peter Carr, Obadiah Clifford, and
John MacCormack. Through the courtesy of the Presbyterians,
their neighbors of the Episcopal faith held their services from time
to time in this old church until the erection of the first Saint James
Church on Church Street in 1812, long delayed because of conflicting
views as to whether the new building should be in town or
country.</p>

<p>This first Saint James Church "was built of brick and quite small,
the windows not arched and there was a yard in front. This church
was torn down in 1836 and a new one, much wider and larger built,
the foundation brought more to the front. It was enlarged in 1848,
the vestibule built over the remainder of the yard, bringing the front
of the church even with the street."<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> This building continued to be
used until the present Saint James Church of gray stone on the
corner of Cornwall and Wirt Streets was completed in 1897.</p>

<p>To the diversity in origin of the county's population frequent
reference has been made. The inhabitants of the southern part were
far more in sympathy in political philosophy, in manner of living, in
agricultural practices and in traditional background with the people
of Fairfax than were they with, perhaps, the majority of the heterogeneous
population of upper Loudoun. Also their leaders belonged
to the class which has ruled in Tidewater Virginia since its English
beginnings and they none too willingly faced the prospect, after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Revolution, of dividing their authority with and perhaps losing their
dominance to the upper-country people. In 1782 they sought to
create a new county coextensive with Cameron Parish; failing in
that, a compromise was reached in 1798 by which the erstwhile area
of Loudoun, south of Sugar Land Run, was returned to Fairfax&mdash;"All
that part of the County of Loudoun" reads the act of division "lying
between the lower boundary thereof and a line to be drawn from the
mouth of Sugar Land Run, to Carter's Mill on Bull Run, shall be
and is hereby added to and made a part of the County of Fairfax."<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
This action had the immediate result of greatly strengthening the
political power of the Quakers, Germans and Scotch-Irish in the remaining
part of the county and correspondingly diminishing the
influence of the descendants of the old Tidewater aristocracy there.</p>

<p>In the year 1787 Colonel Leven Powell laid out the town of
Middleburg on the road running to Ashley's Gap, for his purpose devoting
fifty acres on the southerly edge of the 500 acre tract of land
he had purchased from Joseph Chinn in 1763;<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> the town, of course,
obtaining its name from the position it occupied approximately halfway
between the major towns of Alexandria and Winchester as well
as halfway between the courthouses of Loudoun and Fauquier. The
first trustees were Francis Peyton, William Bronaugh, William
Heale, John Peyton Harrison, Burr Powell, Josias Clapham, and
Richard Bland Lee.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>The much older town of Waterford did not receive formal legislative
sanction until 1801. Then by the fifth section of an act of the
Legislature, the place is recognized as already in existence: "the lots
and streets as the same are already laid off at the place known by the
name of Waterford." The first trustees were James Moore, James
Griffith, John Williams, and Abner Williams. Section 7 of the act
further provided "that as soon as Mahlon Janey and William Hough,
shall lay off into lots with convenient streets, so much of their lands
not exceeding ten acres adjoining the said town of Waterford, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
same shall thence-forth constitute and be deemed and taken as a
part of the said town."<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>The next year another old settlement was, in its turn, given legislative
acknowledgment. Hillsborough, somewhat belatedly, was
"established" on twenty-five acres already divided between a score
or more of owners: Mahlon Hough, Thomas Purcell, the representatives
of John Jenny (sic), deceased, Thomas Leslie, Thomas Hepburn,
Joseph Tribby, Josiah White, John Foundling, Edward Conrod,
Mahlon Roach, Thomas Stevens, Thomas Hough, Samuel
Purcell, John Wolfcaile, Richard Matthews, James Prior, John
Stevens, Richard Copeland, and Mahlon Morris. The first trustees
were Mahlon Hough, Thomas Purcell, Thomas Leslie, Josiah
White, Edward Conrod, Mahlon Roach, and Thomas Stevens.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>In 1810 Aldie makes its appearance. It was laid out by Charles
Fenton Mercer, a great Loudoun figure in his day,<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> on a part of his
plantation to which he had given the name of Aldie in tribute to
Aldie Castle in Scotland, the seat of that Mercer family from which
he believed himself descended. The act of establishment describes
the town's location as "thirty acres of land lying on the westerly
extremity of the Little River Turnpike road, in the county of Loudoun,
the property of Charles F. Mercer, as soon as the same shall
be laid off into lots with convenient streets." The Little River Turnpike
road had been extended to that point but a few years before.
The town's first trustees were named as Israel Lacey, William Cook,
Matthew Adams, John Sinclair, James Hexon, David Gibson,
Charles F. Mercer, and William Noland.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>Bluemont, under its earlier name of Snickersville which it bore
until the year 1900, was established in 1824. As early as 1769 Edward
Snickers had obtained a grant from John Augustine Washington
of 624 acres at this point and before and after that time had acquired
other lands in the neighbourhood. He it was who, according
to our local tradition, conveyed the first bushel of wheat easterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
across the Blue Ridge and gave his name not only to the village but
to the gap through the Blue Ridge and, on the other side, to the historic
ferry across the Shenandoah which he owned for many years.
He was born about 1735, married Elizabeth Toliaferro about 1755
and died in 1790. In 1806 a postoffice had been established at the
little village with Lewis Stevens acting as postmaster. When the
town came to be formally "established" in 1824, its location was
described as being upon "ten acres at the entrance of Snickers Gap,
of the Blue Ridge Mountains in the county of Loudoun, property of
Amos Clayton, Martha Clayton, William Woodford and others, as
soon as the same shall be laid off into lots with convenient streets and
alleys." The first trustees were James Cochran senior, Craven Osburn,
Mordecai Throckmorton, Stephen Janney, Doctor E. B.
Brady, Amos Clayton, and Timothy Carrington.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>The above list, with Leesburg, is the roll of earlier incorporated
towns of the county. Hamilton (1875), Lovettsville (1876), Purcellville
(1908), and Round Hill (1900), as the dates indicate,
were not formally organized until much later. The pleasant little
village of Lincoln remains unincorporated.</p>

<p>As the eighteenth century neared its end, an increasing number
of representatives of the Tidewater gentry came to Loudoun and
with their neighbours already living there, built far more pretentious
homes than the county had theretofore known. As has been stated
in the preface, to tell something of the stories of these old estates was
the original incentive to the writing of this book; but those stories,
involving as they do their share of romance, tragedy and drama,
must in their more extensive narration, be left for a later volume. It
is appropriate however, in this place, to very briefly comment on a
few of these old plantations.</p>


<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Springwood</span></div>

<p>Among the newcomers, in this post-revolution period, was Colonel
Burgess Ball, a great-grandson of that dignified old aristocrat
Colonel William Ball of Millenbeck on the Rappahannock, in Lancaster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
County, who had come to Virginia in 1657. During the Revolution
Burgess Ball had served on the staff of General Washington,
his first cousin, then as a captain in the Continental Line and later
had raised and equipped a Virginia regiment at his own expense and
served with it as lieutenant colonel. After the war, his health broken
and his generous fortune seriously impaired by his expenditures for
military purposes and by his extravagant hospitality at his home,
Travellers Rest in Spotsylvania County, he in 1795, was obliged to
seek refuge in what was still known in Tidewater as the Loudoun
wilderness. On the 4th November, 1795, he purchased for £1741
(the proceeds of his back pay for military services it is said) from
Abraham Barnes Thomson Mason, only acting executor and trustee
under the will of Thomson Mason, a tract of 247 acres including the
Great Spring and running to the Potomac. Here Colonel Ball either
built a rustic lodge for his home or, as has been surmised, occupied
and improved the old home of Francis Aubrey, calling his estate
Springwood. On that same 4th November, 1795, there was purchased
in trust for Colonel Ball from Stevens Thomson Mason by
William Fitzhugh, Mann Page, and Alexander Spotswood "three
of the trustees appointed by an Act of General Assembly to sell
certain lands devised by James Ball deceased to his grandson Burgess
Ball for his life," another tract of 147 acres about two miles north
of the Great Spring for £441, current money of Virginia. Other adjacent
tracts were purchased by Colonel Ball or by his trustees until
he controlled a very large estate from the Great Spring to the Limestone
Run of the most fertile land in the county.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Far from his old
military companions, he kept up a correspondence with them in his
distant abode and many of them visited him there from time to
time; for whether surrounded by the refinements of Travellers Rest
or the wilderness of Springwood, Colonel Ball's lavish hospitality was
a part of the very man himself. He died on the 7th March, 1800,
and was buried just outside the graveyard surrounding the old
chapel above Goose Creek on the hill above the Great Spring. This
first Springwood dwelling was not on the site of the present mansion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
but is believed to have been on the south side of the present road on
what is now a part of the Big Spring estate, in recent years known
as Mayfield. The existing Springwood residence was built by George
Washington Ball, later Captain C.S.A., grandson of Colonel Burgess
Ball, between 1840 and 1850. Louis Philippe is said to have been an
overnight guest there and, during the Civil War, General Lee, a
cousin of Captain Ball who had served on his staff, held a military
conference in the present dining room. The estate was acquired in
1869 by the late Francis Asbury Lutz of Washington who substantially
remodelled the mansion very soon thereafter. Since then it
has been in the possession of the Lutz family, its present occupants
being Mrs. Samuel S. Lutz, her son-in-law and daughter, Judge
and Mrs. J. R. H. Alexander and the latter's two sons.</p>


<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Raspberry Plain</span></div>

<p>The genesis of Raspberry Plain, just north of Springwood, has
already been given. As shewn in Chapter VII, the property had
been originally acquired from Lord Fairfax by Joseph Dixon in 1731
and he had sold the farm which he had improved with a dwelling,
orchard, etc., to Aeneas Campbell in 1754. Campbell, as we have
seen, was Loudoun's first sheriff. He maintained the county jail and
the ducking-stool at his home while he held that office. He sold the
place in 1760 to Thomson Mason. So far the residence, long since
vanished, was near the large spring, now a part of Selma. Mason is
said by T. A. Lancaster, Jr., to have built a new house about 1771
(on the site of the present beautiful home). He then conveyed it
to his son Stevens Thomson Mason, subsequently confirming his
action in his will. Later, according to local tradition, another Mason
descendant, Colonel John Mason McCarty was living there when
he killed his cousin, General A. T. Mason in the famous duel in
1819, perhaps as a tenant, for the county records show that in 1830
the estate, then of about 250 acres, was conveyed by the executors
of General Mason's will to George, John, Peter and Samuel Hoffman
of Baltimore for $8,500. It remained in the Hoffman family for
over eighty-five years and until sold by the Hoffman heirs on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
29th April, 1916, to Mr. John G. Hopkins who built the present
imposing brick edifice of colonial architecture. The estate was purchased
by Mr. and Mrs. William H. Lipscomb of Washington in
1931 and, until Mrs. Lipscomb's death, was the scene of many a
gay and picturesque hunt breakfast given in honour of the Loudoun
Hunt of which Mr. Lipscomb was Master.</p>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Belmont</span></div>

<p>Ludwell Lee, a son of Richard Henry Lee, built Belmont in 1800
and lived there until his death in 1836. He rests in its garden. Soon
after he died the estate was acquired by Miss Margaret Mercer who,
born in 1791, was the daughter of Governor John Francis Mercer of
Cedar Park, Maryland. Miss Mercer conducted a school for young
ladies at Belmont until her death in 1846. She was a woman of broad
education with pronounced views on the abolition of negro slavery
and she it was who built the nearby Belmont Chapel on a part of her
estate. After passing through the hands of many owners the property
was purchased in 1931 by Colonel Patrick J. Hurley, Secretary of
War under President Hoover, and since then he and Mrs. Hurley
have made it their country home. For several years he has invited
the Loudoun Hunt to hold its annual horse show there.</p>


<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Coton</span></div>

<p>Across the highway Thomas Ludwell Lee, cousin to Ludwell Lee,
about the same time built his home Coton, naming it after an English
home of the earlier Lees. On Lafayette's visit to America in 1825,
he was a guest of Ludwell Lee and a great festival, in honor of his
visit, was staged at both Belmont and Coton. It is said that after
nightfall a double line of slaves, each holding aloft a flaming torch,
was stationed between the two mansions to light the way of the celebrants
as they passed from one house to the other. The original mansion
has long since disappeared save for parts of its foundations. A
second mansion was later erected on another part of the estate and
in turn was destroyed by fire. The present stone dwelling, the
third to bear the name, was erected by Mr. and Mrs. Warner
Snider, the present owners of the estate, in 1931.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>
<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Oatlands</span></div>

<p>George Carter, great-grandson of Robert Carter, the "King Carter"
of early Colonial days, received in 1800 from his father, Councillor
Robert Carter of Naomi Hall, a tract of 6,000 acres south of Leesburg,
a small part of the vast Carter holdings. Upon this land during
the ensuing two years he built Oatlands, the most pretentious and
elaborate of the Loudoun homes of that day. George Carter did not
marry until attaining the discreet age of sixty years when he took as
his bride Mrs. Betty Lewis, a widow, who had been a Miss Grayson.
Both George Carter and his wife are buried in the gardens of Oatlands.
The estate was acquired in 1903 by the late William Corcoran
Eustis of Washington and is now the country home of his widow
under whose care both residence and extensive gardens retain their
justly celebrated charm and beauty. Mrs. Eustis, a daughter of the
late Levi P. Morton, at one time Governor of New York and later
Vice-President of the United States, has long been the Lady Bountiful
of Loudoun. None of the county's residents has ever equalled her
benefactions to its poor and to its public institutions of every kind.</p>


<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Rokeby</span></div>

<p>Rokeby, on the old Carolina Road south of Leesburg, so long the
home of the Bentley family, also belongs to this period. It acquired its
claim to fame during the War of 1812 when, in 1814, President
Madison, in expectation of the capture of Washington, sent many
of the more valuable Federal archives, including the <i>Declaration of
Independence</i> and, it is said, the Constitution of the United States,
to Leesburg for safekeeping whence they were removed to Rokeby
and stored for two weeks in its vaults. It is now the home of Mr. and
Mrs. B. F. Nalle who, upon its purchase by them many years ago,
made great changes in the old building.</p>


<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Foxcroft</span></div>

<p>When, in the year 1914, Miss Charlotte Noland purchased the
lovely old estate of Foxcroft, four miles north of Middleburg, there
began a new era both in its interesting story and in the educational<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
standards of Loudoun. No modern institution of the county has
spread more generally knowledge of its charms than the famous
school which Miss Noland then founded; and it is particularly appropriate
that the institution should owe its inception and development
to one who in singular degree is a representative of Loudoun's
founders. Those Loudoun citizens of today who trace their descent
to one of the earlier Nabobs of the county feel a complacent satisfaction
therein; but Miss Noland unites lineal descent not only from
Francis Aubrey and Philip Noland but from Colonel Leven Powell
and Burr Harrison, the earliest explorer, as well, thus inheriting an
early Loudoun background believed to be unique.</p>

<span class="caption">Photograph by Miss Frances B. Johnston<br />

<span class="smcap">Foxcroft</span>, Garden Front.</span>
</div>

<p>As is the case with so many of the older houses of the county, the
age of Foxcroft and the identity of its builder are uncertain; but the
local tradition is that it is one of the earliest of the many old brick
houses to be found in that part of the county and that its builder
was one Kyle who had married a daughter of the Balls. The story
goes on that Mrs. Kyle lost her mind after the birth of one of her
children and that for a long time thereafter she was enchained in
the garret of the old house until, during the absence of her husband
on a journey, she freed herself and fell to her death down the stairs.
Another local story is that the building of the house was under the
supervision of William Benton, the land-steward and friend of President
Monroe who, it is said learned brick-making in his native England,
discovered good brick-clay in the Middleburg neighborhood
and made the brick for most of the early brick houses in that part of
the County.</p>

<p>With these local stories as a guide, an examination of the county
records show a John Kile to have been a purchaser of land as early
as 1797 and also a deed to John Kile from William Shrieves, then of
Kentucky, on the 8th February, 1814, of 189 acres "on the waters
of Goose Creek" for £320. The description, running as it does from
one marked tree in the forest to another, requires a long search and
careful plotting to definitely place the property, but it suggests the
Foxcroft estate. That these Kiles or Kyles were quite certainly people
of standing is indicated by their marriages. John Kile, Jr., presumably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the son of the first John Kile, married Winney Powell, a
daughter of Elisha Powell and her sister Mary became the wife of
Pierce Noland.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> It all goes to suggest that the old Foxcroft mansion
was built by John Kile from brick made under the supervision of
William Benton sometime during the 1820's.</p>

<p>Foxcroft School has become so much a part of Loudoun that it is
as difficult to picture the Middleburg neighbourhood without it as it
would be to think of Middleburg without its famous fox-hunting.
The school has eighty-five students, representative of the most
prominent families in the United States from coast to coast, with
students from abroad as well and there is always a long waiting list
of applicants for admission. A healthy outdoor life is combined with
carefully planned study. The young ladies are all expert riders, follow
the Middleburg Hunt at its numerous meets and every year,
since 1915, have their own horse show in May at Foxcroft which
is always a brilliant affair.</p>


<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Llangollan</span></div>

<p>Llangollan was built about 1810 by Cuthbert Powell, (1775-1849)
a son of Colonel Leven Powell from whom he had inherited
the land upon the latter's death at Fort Bedford, Pennsylvania, on
the 6th August, 1810. Few families in Virginia are more deeply
rooted in her history than the Powells. Captain William Powell,
who, as a gentleman adventurer, accompanied Captain John Smith
to Virginia in 1607 is claimed in the family chronicles to be one of
the clan. Whether he was kinsman to that Nathaniel Powell who
was with Smith in his brush with the Manahoacs on the Rappahannock
in the summer of 1608 does not appear. After spending some
years in business pursuits in Alexandria, Cuthbert Powell returned
to Loudoun where he served as a justice, represented the county in
the Virginia Legislature as a Whig and was a member of Congress
from 1841 to 1843. Chief Justice Marshall once described him as
"the most talented man of that talented family." In 1930 Llangollan
was acquired by Mr. and Mrs. John Hay Whitney of New York<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
who have greatly enlarged the old stone mansion and made the
estate the home of one of the most famous racing establishments in
America. They organized in 1932 and hold there each year the
Llangollan Gold Cup races.</p>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Morrisworth</span></div>

<p>The 750 acres which originally composed Morrisworth were given
by William Ellzey to his daughter Catherine who married Mathew
Harrison of Dumfries. After his death his widow, with her children,
took possession of her patrimony and in 1811 built thereon the main
part of the stone mansion. There she resided for the remainder of her
life and reared her large family. Her children continued to own the
estate until they sold it about 1870 to their kinsman Dr. Thomas
Miller of Washington who, dying about two years later, never resided
there. He left the property to his daughters, the mansion and
about 550 acres going to Miss Virginia Miller and Mrs. Arthur
Fendall. In turn these ladies deeded the estate in 1900 to Mrs. Fendall's
son Thomas M. Fendall, the present owner, who, in 1915,
added the south wing to the house. Mr. and Mrs. Fendall have
greatly enlarged and developed the gardens, specializing in iris to
such an extent that Morrisworth has become widely known not only
for the beautiful scene when the five thousand plants are in bloom
but for the many new varieties of iris originated there.</p>


<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Chestnut Hill</span></div>

<p>Chestnut Hill near the Point of Rocks, so long identified with the
Mason Family, is another of the mansions built about 1800. Samuel
Clapham, the son of the second Josias Clapham, was the builder on
land he had acquired in 1796 from his father. It came to Thomas F.
Mason through his marriage to Betsey Price, a granddaughter of
the second Josias as related in Chapter VII. It is now owned and occupied
by Mr. and Mrs. Coleman Gore.</p>


<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Rockland</span></div>

<p>Rockland, four miles north of Leesburg, was built by General
George Rust in 1822 on land acquired by him in 1817 from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
heirs of Colonel Burgess Ball and is unique among the county's old
estates in that today it still is owned by a descendant of its builder,
Mrs. Stanley M. Brown, who before her marriage was Miss Elizabeth
Fitzhugh Rust, the only child of the late owner, Mr. Henry B.
Rust. Mr. and Mrs. Brown, with their children, spend each summer
at Rockland. The 419 acres of the present estate border for a long
distance on the Potomac and are regarded as equalling in fertility
any land in the county. During the War Between the States the old
house witnessed the alternate passing and repassing of the armies of
the North and South in front of it along the old Carolina Road.
Hospitality and gracious living have long been synonymous in
Loudoun with the very name of Rockland.</p>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Exeter</span></div>

<p>The plantation that became Exeter was inherited by Mary Mason
Seldon; a sister of Thomson Mason, from their mother Ann Thompson
Mason. This Mary Mason Seldon married, first, Mann Page
and upon his death took as her second husband her first cousin Dr.
Wilson Cary Seldon who, born in 1761, had served as surgeon in a
Virginia artillery regiment during the Revolution. Though she had
children by Page and none by Seldon, the latter secured this land
and between 1796 and 1800 built the main frame dwelling with its
pleasing design and interesting detail. The large brick extension in
the rear was added by General George Rust about 1854 during his
ownership of the estate. By his second wife, Dr. Seldon had a
daughter, Eleanor, and it was at Exeter on the 16th February 1843,
that she married John Augustine Washington, the last of his
family to own and occupy Mount Vernon. When the War Between
the States broke out, he at once volunteered for service, became an
aide on the staff of General Lee with the rank of lieutenant colonel
and was killed in a small engagement, which otherwise would have
been unimportant, at Cheat Mountain, now West Virginia, on the
13th September, 1861. In 1857 Exeter was purchased by the late
Horatio Trundle. It was inherited by his son Mr. Hartley H. Trundle
who with his family resides there.</p>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Selma</span></div>

<p>Selma, another part of Mrs. Ann Thomson Mason's great purchase
of "wild lands," saw its first mansion built between 1800 and
1810 by General Armistead Thomson Mason, United States Senator
from Virginia (affectionately known as "the Chief of Selma")
when he was killed by his cousin, John Mason McCarty, in the
famous duel at Bladensburg on the 6th February, 1819. He had inherited
the land from his father Stevens Thomson Mason of Raspberry
Plain. The property was purchased in 1896 by the late Colonel
Elijah B. White, who afterward represented the Loudoun district in
the Virginia Senate and was for many years a prominent Leesburg
banker. He was a son of the much-loved leader of White's Battalion
in the War of 1861. Upon his purchase of the estate, Colonel White
built the present stately mansion, so famed for its hospitality, in
which he incorporated parts of the older house, burned some years before.
Selma is now owned by Colonel White's widow (who before her
marriage was Miss Lalla Harrison) and his daughter, Miss Elizabeth
White. It long has had the reputation of being one of the most fertile
and successfully managed farming estates in the East.</p>


<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Aldie Manor</span></div>

<p>Aldie Manor, in the present town of Aldie, was built by Charles
Fenton Mercer and named for Aldie Castle in Scotland, the home of
the Mercer family. The town in turn was named for the estate and
the Magisterial District in which both lie is named for Mercer. The
mansion has long been owned and occupied by the diZerega family.</p>


<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Morven Park</span></div>

<p>Morven Park was acquired by Governor Thomas Swann of Maryland
who, about 1825, built the imposing mansion there. It was inherited
by his daughter who became the wife of Dr. Shirley Carter
and for many years much of the neighbourhood's social life centered
about it. In 1903 this estate of over 1,000 acres was purchased by
Mr. Westmoreland Davis, later Governor of Virginia, who now resides
there and carefully supervises the many and varied agricultural
activities of his domain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Oak Hill</span></div>

<p>But to the nation the best known of all the old homes of Loudoun
has always been Oak Hill. When James Monroe, after long years of
service to his country, came to look forward to his retirement, he
owned a large tract of land on the Carolina Road nine miles south
of Leesburg, long in the possession of his family, which had occupied
a dormer-windowed cottage there. On a gentle elevation on the
plantation, President Monroe, in the year 1820, erected the great
brick house, three stories in height with its porticos and Doric
columns which he named Oak Hill. It was designed by Monroe's
friend Thomas Jefferson and the plans were completed by James
Hoban the designer and builder of the White House and the supervising
architect of the Capitol. President Monroe employed William
Benton, an Englishman (who is said to have "served him in the triple
capacity of steward, counsellor and friend") to superintend the construction
of the mansion under Hoban's supervision and to manage
the extensive farming operations of the estate which he did most successfully.
It was here that President Monroe wrote his famous message
to Congress, delivered in December 1823, embodying what
since has been known throughout the world as the "Monroe Doctrine"
and it was here also that he entertained Lafayette in 1825.
Mrs. Monroe died at Oak Hill in 1830. On Mr. Monroe's death in
1831, the property went to his daughter Mrs. Gouveneur of New
York by whom it was sold in 1852 to Colonel John M. Fairfax, who
set out the large orchard of Albemarle Pippins some of the fruit from
which, sent to Queen Victoria gave her such pleasure that thereafter
it enjoyed her preference over all other apples. Later when his
son, the much-loved State Senator Henry Fairfax, owned the estate
he became known throughout the nation for the Hackney horses
he raised there. In 1920 the property was acquired by Mr. and Mrs.
Frank C. Littleton who greatly enlarged the old building by the extension
of both wings. When Mr. Littleton was quarrying sandstone
on the place in 1923 there were found numerous imprints of prehistoric
dinosaurs&mdash;the first known evidence that these monsters had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
inhabited this portion of the eastern part of the present United
States.</p>

<p>The estate took its name from a group of oaks planted on the
lawn by President Monroe, one from each of the then existing
States, each tree presented to him for that purpose by a congressman
from the State represented.</p>

<p>Mrs. Littleton died in 1924. Mr. Littleton and his son Frank C.
Littleton, Jr., continue to make the historic old place their home,
carrying on extensive farming operations on its broad acres.</p>

<p>On the 20th March, 1793, the first postoffice was established in
Leesburg. The first postmaster was Thomas Lewis, who was succeeded
on the 1st April, 1794, by John Schooley, who in turn gave
way to John Shaw on the 1st April, 1801. Then came Thomas
Wilkinson on the 1st April, 1803; William Woody on the 1st January,
1804, and Presley Saunders on the 12th February, 1823.</p>

<p>At the end of the eighteenth century Loudoun was, in politics, a
Federal stronghold. Colonel Leven Powell has long been credited
with being the founder of that party in the county. The momentous
election for members of the Convention of 1788 was bitterly fought.
Stevens Thomson Mason and William Ellzey, both lawyers, were
opposed to the adoption of the Federal Constitution. For its adoption
stood Colonel Powell and Colonel Josias Clapham. Both of the latter,
as we have seen, were old soldiers but no match as orators to their
opponents and thus were at a great disadvantage in the contest.
Powell's great personal popularity alone is said to have secured his
election. Mason also won but the county remained so strongly
Federal that its vote dominated its Congressional District.</p>

<p>When war with Great Britain was forced upon us in 1812, a cavalry
regiment was raised in Loudoun of which Armistead Thomson
Mason of Selma became colonel. But the incident in that war which
most prominently stands out in Loudoun's memory came in 1814.</p>

<p>After the American forces under General William H. Winder
had been defeated by the British at Bladensburg in August of that
year, it was apparent that the capture of Washington was highly
probable. Madison's Secretary of State, James Monroe, had been in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the camp of General Winder, closely studying with him the enemy's
movements and seeking to appraise the ability of the Americans to
successfully defend the Capital. That he was not reassured by what
he thus learned is shewn by the letter he sent to President Madison
wherein he advised him to remove from Washington the government's
more important records. The President recognized, none too
soon, the imminence of the danger. The more valuable of the government
archives were ordered to be taken from Washington and
Stephen Pleasanton, then a clerk in the State Department, was
placed in charge of their removal. He caused to be made a large number
of linen bags in which were placed the government's books and
documents, including the <i>Declaration of Independence</i> and the Constitution.
It is said that the painting of Mrs. Dolly Madison, hanging
in the White House, was cut from its frame and accompanied
the government's records. Some accounts aver that, so numerous
were the archives, twenty-two two-horse wagons were used in their
transportation from Washington; others who have written of the
incident say that four four-horse wagons only were used, while still
others claim the method of transportation to have been by ox-teams.
However they were carried, they left Washington across the old
Chain Bridge and sought their first safety in the grist mill of Edward
Patterson on the Virginia side of the Potomac two miles above
Georgetown. So threatening was the British advance, however, that
it was deemed prudent to carry the precious cargo further up-country;
the wagons were duly reloaded and the caravan continued to
Leesburg, where the sacks were placed for one night in the courthouse
according to some writers or, on the authority of others, in a
vacant building in the town, the key of which was given to a certain
Rev. Mr. Littlejohn, a young clergyman then recently ordained.
The next day the sacks were again placed in the wagons and driven
to the nearby plantation of Rokeby where in its vaults they were
stored for two weeks until it was safe to return them to Washington.</p>

<p>During those two weeks President Madison was a guest of Ludwell
Lee at Belmont, whence he directed National affairs; and ever
since that time it has been a primary and essential asseveration in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
credo of every true Leesburger that the town was, during that stirring
fortnight, the de facto Capital of the United States.</p>

<p>Proud as that memory may be today, the event itself is said to
have caused great anxiety to the more substantial citizens of the
town and nearby country for fear lest their sudden prominence in
the affairs of the nation would invite a swift and disastrous foray
upon them by the temporarily triumphant Britons; a denouement
which, happily, did not ensue.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>MATURITY</h3>


<p>When Patrick McIntyre published the one hundred and
tenth number of <i>The True American</i> in Leesburg on
Tuesday the 30th December, 1800, he, following the
tradition of his craft, probably left his office with a lively sense of
anticipation of the town's forthcoming celebration of the advent of a
new century; that he could have foreseen that a single copy of that
issue would be the sole available survivor of his journal in 1937 is not
to be presumed. Yet in the Library of Congress that single copy begins
its collection of Leesburg's newspapers and no copy of the paper
is known to survive today in Loudoun. Its four pages devote themselves
to the proceedings of Congress, to European affairs, to the
activities of the Virginia House of Delegates and to the new treaty
with France. The local news must be gleaned from the advertisements.
The Rev. Mr. Allen advertises religious services to be held in
the courthouse;<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> one W. C. Celden, a slavedealer, informs the public
that he "has some likely young NEGROES which he will dispose
of reasonably for cash;" and on the 4th page is found an item, obviously
inserted by a private individual protecting himself with a cloak
of anonymity, "For Sale. A likely NEGRO GIRL who has to serve
for the term of nineteen or twenty years. She is now about twelve
years of age, and very well grown, and will have to serve one year
for every child which she may have during the term of her servitude.
The terms of sale may be known by application to the Printer." The
widow of Colonel Burgess Ball asks that those having claims against
his estate will send them to her as the Administrators were anxious
to make provision for their immediate payment.</p>

<p>The ultimate fate of <i>The True American</i> is unknown. In 1808
there was established in the town the <i>Washingtonian</i> which became
the recognized organ of the Democratic party in Northern Virginia
for many years. No surviving copy of any issue of the first year of
this paper has been found by the present writer. Until 1841 it divided
the Loudoun field with Whig competitors; after that date its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
journalistic rivals appear to have been of its own political faith,
notably the <i>Loudoun Mirror</i>, established in 1855. In its early years
the <i>Washingtonian</i> had a sturdy competitor in the Whig <i>Genius of
Liberty</i>, copies of which are now rarely to be found. The most numerous
available are in a broken file in the Library of Congress, beginning
with numbers issued in 1817 and owing their conservation to
the fact that they had been sent by the editor to the Secretary of
State. As with the earlier <i>True American</i> these newspapers contain
much foreign news and correspondence with lengthy reports of
legislative activities in Richmond and Washington; and, in addition,
an acrimonious and undignified exchange of long-winded and abusive
letters in the Mason-McCarty-Mercer controversies. But that
a county paper should find its first duty in presenting local news was
not within the philosophy of the editor. Only here and there may
one find a paragraph recording some local incident&mdash;but patient
search is occasionally rewarded. A branch of the Bank of the Valley
had been opened in Leesburg in 1818 with local subscribers to its
stock and T. R. Mott acting as cashier. Then in the issue of the 31st
March, 1818, we read:</p>

<p>"Specie. Arrived on Wednesday last at this port after a pleasant
passage of two days from Alexandria, the waggon Perseverance&mdash;Grub,
Master, laden with SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS
IN SPECIE for the Branch Bank of the Valley in this place. The
Specie is deposited in the 'Strong box' thus laying a foundation for
the emission of a paper currency predicated upon Specie Capital,
which is the chief corner stone in all monied institutions; without it
they must eventually fail."</p>

<p>That Leesburg was provided with its first street pavements
through the proceeds of a public lottery has long been town gossip.
By way of confirmation, there is an advertisement in the 12th May,
1818, issue of the <i>Genius of Liberty</i>: "By authority. Scheme of Lottery
to raise $8000 for the purpose of paving the streets of the town
of Leesburg, Va." providing a first prize of $4000 and 2011 other
prizes running from $1000 down to $6 each, totalling $30,000.
Against these 2012 prizes were to be 3988 blanks, to be represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
by 6000 tickets to be offered at $5 each; but the astute managers
stipulated that many of the larger prizes were to be paid in part by
other tickets and that each of the prizes were to be "subject to a deduction
of $15 to $100." To inspire the confidence of the public, the
notice was signed by the following representative citizens as Commissioners:
Prestley Cardell, C. F. Mercer, George Rust, Joseph
Beard, Richd H. Henderson, Samuel Clapham, John Humphreys,
John I. Harding, Sampson Blincoe, Fleet Smith, Samuel Carr, and
John Gray. So successful was the lottery, avers tradition, that with
its profits not only was the town able to pave its principal streets but
also brought in, through wooden pipes, a much needed supply of
water from Rock Spring, the present home of Mrs. H. T. Harrison.
To the community that system of finance exerted an appeal so
strong that once again it was used in 1844, to raise the necessary
money to build an office for the County Clerk. The present County
Office Building was purchased from the trustees of the Leesburg
Academy in 1879.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>Always has Loudoun been a horse-loving country; but it may
surprise some of her people of today to know that in 1817 the county
seat possessed a "Jockey Club" which was sufficiently strong and
well supported to conduct a four day racing meet with more generous
prizes than are now offered. In the <i>Genius of Liberty</i> of the 14th
October 1817 there is this advertisement:</p>

<p>"Leesburg Jockey Club. RACES will be run for on Wednesday
the 15th October, over a handsome course near the town. A Purse
of 200 Dollars three miles and repeat, and on Thursday the 16th
day, two miles and repeat a Purse of $100 Dollars, and on Friday the
17th and repeat, a Towne's Purse of at least $150 and on Saturday
the 18th an elegant SADDLE, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'BRIDDLE': see Transcriber's note for ad as it appeared in the 'Genius of Liberty'.">BRIDLE</ins>
and MARTINGALE,
worth at least FIFTY DOLLARS. P. SAUNDERS, sec'y &amp;
treas'r."</p>

<p>Thus, although the local reporting was definitely remiss in those
days, the advertising columns yield much treasure. The times were
hard, land sales forced by worried creditors were frequent and often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
in the sales advertisements a note is made of log-houses on the land,
shewing how numerous that form of habitation still must have been
in the Loudoun of that time. With the land sales are many offerings
of negroes, not infrequently with a humanitarian undertone pleasant
to read, for in Loudoun then there was much anti-slavery sentiment
not only among Quakers and Germans but, more significantly,
among the wealthy planters and educated town folk. Thus in the
issue of the 26th October 1818:</p>

<p>"Negroes for Sale. For Sale, a family of Negroes, consisting of a
woman and children. To a good master they will be sold a great
bargain. They will not be sold to a southern trader."</p>

<p>The financial stress of the day then, as later, bred much discontent
if we may judge from the frequent notices of runaway white apprentices
and negro slaves, the latter of both sexes; but while in the
case of the slaves rewards are offered for their return of varying
amounts from $5 to $200, the masters of the white apprentices, apparently
appraising their services somewhat dubiously, offered but
from one to six cents for their apprehension and return!</p>

<p>Though times were hard and money scarce there was, in the community,
a healthy appreciation of the cultural side of life. George
Carter of Oatlands advertises the services of a professor of music,
seemingly brought into the county by him, who "now offers to
teach the fundamental rules of this science in 8 lessons so as to enable
those who are taught by him, to pursue their studies by themselves
until they may obtain a perfect practical knowledge of musick."<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
Music seemed to have been in the air. Eighteen months later, there
is notice given by Henry Krebs that he has commenced teaching
the piano and German flute and the French language. He could be
found at Mrs. Peers' boarding house.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Lectures on English grammar
are announced by E. Hazen at the house of Mrs. McCabe<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> and
Charles Weineder, a miniature painter, came to Leesburg for two
weeks to take orders in his art.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p><p>The profession of the law was followed in Leesburg by Richard
Henderson, Burr William Harrison, L. P. W. Balch (who was also
secretary of the school board) and John K. Mines. Dr. J. Clapper
practiced medicine at Hillsboro "where he may be found at Mr.
Hough's tavern," we trust not indicating undue conviviality of the
gentleman's disposition. There was ample accomodation for travellers,
their servants and horses. Enos Wildman announced that he
had lately acquired the Eagle Tavern, formerly run by W. Austen;<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
while Samuel M. Edwards presided at the "Leesburg Hotel &amp; Coffee
House" which he had recently purchased from Mr. H. Peers and
which was "situated on the main street leading from Winchester to
Alexandria, George Town and the City of Washington." Yet
another tavern was operated by one "Mr. Foley" and, as we have
seen, there were boarding-houses as well. Their bars were stocked
without difficulty, for Lewis Mix &amp; Co. had a distillery near the
mouth of Sugar Land Run and called for rye, corn and oats.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most impressive picture painted by these old
advertisements is that of the teeming industrial and commercial life
of the town. It was still, happily, the age of the handicraftsman; the
machinery age was yet to come. Transportation was uncertain and
slow, and country towns largely produced the furniture, tools, clothing
and other needed articles for their own inhabitants and those of
their surrounding communities. The variety of the activities of the
artisans and merchants of the Leesburg of that day paralleled those
of other similar towns throughout the nation. John Carney had a
"Boot &amp; Shoe manufactory" which was conveniently located "on
King street, next door to Messrs. Humphreys and Conrad and immediately
opposite the Court House." In advertising his wares, he
added that he wished to take on two or three apprentices of from
thirteen to fifteen years of age. He had a business rival in William
King, who conducted a similar activity and confidently announced
that he had "some of the first rate workmen in the State."</p>

<p>Hats were made and sold by Jacob Martin "at his shop opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the market house" who duly proclaimed "a very large assortment
of hats on hand from the first quality to those of lowest prices; including
a large assortment of Good Wool Hats, likewise some
Morocco Caps."</p>

<p>If the Loudoun citizen of President Monroe's day needed the
services of a tailor, they were made available by Thomas Russel
whose business apparently flourished; for he advertised for "one or
two journeymen taylors to whom constant employ and the best
wages will be given." He also sought one or two apprentices to learn
his craft.</p>

<p>Jonathan C. May was opening a dry goods and clothing shop
under charge of D. Carter, next to the drug store of Robert R.
Hough. As a competitor he had Joseph Beard with his "General and
Seasonable assortment of Dry Goods" and Daniel P. Conrad who,
"at the Stone House opposite the Court House" offered "a seasonable
supply of Fall Goods"; he and George Richards meanwhile
publishing notice of the dissolution of their former partnership. In
nearby Waterford, B. Williamson and C. Shawen also dissolve their
partnership in a general store, on account of Williamson moving to
Baltimore and Shawen carries on under the name of C. Shawen &amp;
Co.</p>

<p>Samuel Tustin was engaged in a coachmaking business in Leesburg
and sought "good tough white ash plant and timber&mdash;also a
quantity of poplar half inch plank." He, too, wanted an apprentice,
seeking one who was fifteen to seventeen years old. There was no
lack of opportunity to earn a living offered to a steady lad with an
inclination to work and a taste for trade. To the more mature,
Aaron Burson offered to rent his fulling mill and dwelling house
near Union, describing them as being in "an elegant neighbourhood
for the fulling business."<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> John B. Bell, occupying a part of William
Drish's house on King Street, was a bookbinder. Not daunted
by the slump in business, James G. Jones and Company notify the
Loudoun public that they have commenced the brush making business
"at Mr. Wetherby's stone house, King Street, nearly opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Mr. Murrays and that they want a large quantity of hog's bristles"
for which a liberal price will be given "IN CASH."</p>

<p>S. B. T. Caldwell advertised for sale writing paper, wrapping
paper and medium printing paper.</p>

<p>The present day collectors of old furniture will note that David
Ogden had removed his business to the southeast corner of King and
Cornwall Streets where he had on hand and offered "some fashionable
sideboards, Eliptic Dining Tables, Secretary, Bureaus etc., etc.,
which I will dispose of on moderate terms. Orders from the adjacent
country will be thankfully received." In the same year of 1818,
Jacob and Isaac Thomas of Waterford announced that they had on
hand a general assortment of Windsor and fancy chairs and were also
prepared to do "house, sign and fancy painting with neatness and
dispatch."</p>

<p>The political dispute between Mason and McCarthy, mirrored
in the pages of <i>The Genius of Liberty</i>, was fated to resolve itself
into a tragedy that shook county and Commonwealth to their roots
and caused no small sensation throughout the youthful Republic.
General Armistead Thomson Mason of Selma,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> a grandson of Thomson
Mason, was a graduate of William and Mary College, a veteran
of the War of 1812 and a Senator of the United States from Virginia
as well as the leader of the Democratic party in Loudoun. Opposed
to him as a Federalist was his cousin, Colonel John Mason McCarty,
a grandson of George Mason of Gunston Hall, a descendant of old
Daniel McCarthy of Westmoreland<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> and who then occupied Raspberry
Plain. For a long time there had been political rivalry and
bickering between the two men and when Mason introduced a bill
in the Senate to permit Loudoun Quakers, when drafted for military
services in war-time, to furnish substitutes by the payment of $500
apiece, McCarthy seized upon its political possibilities and promptly
accused him of cowardice. The issue flared in the political campaign
then on and, to add to the fire, Mason challenged McCarty's
vote at the polls. Some accounts say that this so incensed McCarthy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
described as being generally a good-natured individual with a strong
sense of humour but also with a temper that upon occasion would
break out beyond bounds, that he thereupon, at the polling place,
defied Mason to personal combat, in his anger naming the weapons,
contrary to a universally recognized rule of the code. Mason decided
to ignore the matter, McCarthy taunted him in the public prints
and although Mason's side had been defeated at the election, the
affair gradually might have blown over and been forgotten had not
Mason, returning from a journey to Richmond, by evil chance found
himself a fellow stagecoach passenger with his old friend and superior
officer, General Andrew Jackson. The matter of the quarrel with
McCarthy, in due course, came up for discussion and Jackson, ever
a fire-eater himself, is said to have told Mason with some brusqueness
that he should not let the matter drop. On his return, therefore,
Mason sent his cousin a letter in which he said he has resigned
his commission for the sole purpose of fighting McCarthy and "I
am now free to accept or send a challenge or to fight a duel. The
public mind has become tranquil, and all suspicion of the further
prosecution of our quarrel having subsided, we can now terminate
it without being arrested by the civil authority and without exciting
alarm among our friends." He informed his opponent that he had
arranged his family affairs and was "extreemly anxious to terminate
once and forever this quarrel." How recklessly eager was his wish
was shewn by his instructions to his seconds to agree to any terms
at any distance&mdash;to pistols, muskets or rifles "to three feet&mdash;his
pretended favourite distance, or to three inches, should his impetuous
courage prefer it."</p>

<p>McCarthy, in the meanwhile, had cooled down and was inclined
to turn aside this new challenge in a humorous vein. He suggested
to Mason's seconds that the antagonists jump from the dome of
the capitol; but the matter had gone too far for joking and he was
told his suggestion did not comply with the code. Again and yet
again he offered similar absurd solutions and being rebuffed and in
an effort to frighten Mason, suggested shotguns loaded with buckshot
at ten paces, suicidal terms which were modified by the seconds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
to charging the weapons with a single ball and the distance to
twelve feet.</p>

<p>After the fatal outcome of the Hamilton-Burr duel in 1804, a
wave of hostility to the whole institution of duelling had swept the
country. In January, 1810, Virginia had passed an act making the
death of a duellist within three months of the encounter, murder,
and providing that the survivor should be hung. Moreover, it was
provided that the mere act of sending or accepting a challenge
should make the offender incapable of holding public office. Therefore
it was expedient that the meeting should not be held in Virginia
and a field, along the side of which ran a little brook, near Bladensburg
in Maryland, was selected for the affair. Principals, seconds
and referee arrived at a nearby inn on the night of the 5th February,
1819, and at 8:00 o'clock the next morning, in the bitter cold and
snow, the cousins confronted each other on the field, standing so
close to one another that their "barrels almost touched." As the
signal was given both fired and then fell to the ground&mdash;Mason
dying and McCarthy dangerously wounded. Mason's body was
brought back to Leesburg where it rested for a while in the old
stone house on Loudoun Street now owned by Mr. T. M. Fendall,
before burial in the St. James graveyard in Church Street with
religious and Masonic rites. There the grave is still to be seen. It
is said that Mrs. Mason locked the main entrance of Selma after
the funeral and that no one again used it until her only son came
of age&mdash;a son destined to meet his death, many years later, as an
American officer, in the battle of Cerro Gordo in our war with
Mexico. Tradition has it that ever after the duel, McCarthy was
a morose and haunted man. A gruesome detail is added that long
after his death his marble gravestone was removed to the Purcell drug
store in Leesburg and there used for many years as a slab on which
prescriptions were compounded.</p>

<p>From such a sombre picture we may turn with relief to the
spectacle of Loudoun in gala attire indulging in the greatest and gayest
county-wide celebration her history affords.</p>

<p>Of all those who, from abroad, came to help the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Colonies in their revolt, none so wholly captured the affections of her
people as the French Marquis de Lafayette and as the years after the
war passed by, that affection remained steadfast. In January, 1824,
the American Congress entertained the happy idea of authorizing
the President to officially invite the old general again to visit our
shores, this time as the guest of the whole nation. Lafayette sailed
from France on an American war ship in July, 1824, arriving in New
York on the 14th August. Then began the national welcome which,
continuing for over a year, stands by itself in our history.</p>

<p>In August, 1825, Lafayette, being in Washington, informed his
hosts that he wished, once again, to see his old friend James Monroe,
then living in retirement on his estate, Oak Hill. Arrangements
were made accordingly and on the 6th August the Marquis, accompanied
by President John Quincy Adams, left Washington in the
latter's carriage for the long drive to Oak Hill. On their arrival they
were greeted by Monroe and a number of his friends who had gathered
to pay honour to the nation's guest. For three days Lafayette
tarried at Oak Hill, walking over the farm with his host and reminiscing
over the heroic days of nearly fifty years before. Leesburg,
determining to show its love and respect for the general, sent a
delegation to invite him to a celebration in his honour in that
town, to which Lafayette readily assented. On the morning of the
9th August, 1825, "Mr. Ball a member of the Committee of
arrangements and Mr. Henderson of the Town Council"<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> went to
Oak Hill to escort their guest to Leesburg. With them were two
troops of cavalry commanded by Captains Chichester and Bradfield.
General Lafayette, President Adams, former President Monroe and
Mr. Henderson took their seats in the carriage drawn by splendid
bay horses which had been provided for the occasion and the procession
set out for the county seat. As it neared the town, salvos of
artillery greeted it and the roads and town itself were so lined and
filled with people that it was estimated that at least 10,000 (almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
half of the county's population) were present. And now, to quote
the historian of the occasion:</p>

<p>"The guest of the nation, with his honoured friends, alighted in
the field of William M. McCarty, where in the shade of an oak, he
was introduced to Cuthbert Powell, Esq., chairman of the committee
of arrangements; who welcomed him in terms of respect and
affection apt to the occasion, and in a manner at once feeling and
grateful; to which General LaFayette replied, with the felicity which
seems never to forsake him. He was then introduced to the committee
of arrangements and to General Rust, the marshall of the day,
and his aids. The General then received the military, assembled to
honour him, consisting of the volunteer troops of cavalry, commanded
by Captains Chichester and Bradfield; the two rifle companies,
commanded by Captains Henry and Humphries; and the
companies of light infantry, commanded by Captains Moore and
Cockerill, who, by their equipments and discipline did credit to
themselves and the county."<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>After being introduced to a few surviving soldiers of the Revolution,
the distinguished party was driven to Colonel Osburn's Hotel
(the present home of Mr. T. M. Fendall on Loudoun Street) the
street in front of which was filled with a great crowd of orderly
and well-behaved citizens. Here Lafayette was received by the
Mayor of Leesburg, Dr. John H. McCabe and the common council.
The mayor made an address of welcome and again Lafayette spoke
in reply.</p>

<p>After a few minutes for rest and refreshment in the hotel, the
carriages were resumed and</p>

<p>"the procession moved through Loudoun, Market, Back, Cornwall
and King Street. Between the gate of the Court house square
and the portico of the court-house an avenue had formed, by a line
on the right, of the young ladies of the Leesburg Female Academy
under the care of Miss Helen McCormick and Mrs. Lawrence
... dressed in white, with blue sashes, and their heads were
tastefully adorned with evergreens. They held sprigs of laurel in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
their hands, which they strewed in the way as the General passed
them."</p>

<p>Another account discloses that the other side of the "avenue,"
facing the evergreen-crowned girls, was formed by a line of boys
from the Leesburg Institute, whose costumes were embellished with
red sashes and white and black cockades. As Lafayette, smiling and
bowing, mounted the portico steps, he was greeted by Ludwell Lee
on behalf of the people of Loudoun with a patriotic speech and
once again the cheerful Marquis managed to make yet another
appropriate response. After a full year of the young Republic's
exuberant enthusiasm, the delivery of a mere half-dozen or so of
speeches of grateful acknowledgment in a single day has lost its
earlier terrors. At 4:00 o'clock a great banquet was spread on the
tables set up in the courthouse square, the guests' table being protected
by an awning. Toasts were enthusiastically given and drunk
to Adams, Lafayette and Monroe, each in turn replying. With that
auspicious start and the stimulus of the potent beverages, it is recorded
that as the time passed, the "volunteer toasts" waxed in number
and ecstacy. Afterward, the distinguished guests visited the home
of Mr. W. T. T. Mason for the baptism of his two infant daughters,
Lafayette acting as godfather for one and Adams and Monroe in
similar capacity for the other. More gayety in Leesburg, then a
drive through the summer night to Belmont and participation in the
merry-making there, before the illustrious visitors sought their
rooms for the night in that gracious mansion.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> As they returned to
Washington the next day, it must have been with a profound, if
weary, appreciation of the county's enthusiasm, affection and hospitality.</p>

<p>In this second quarter of the nineteenth century, to which we
have now come, the name of Charles Fenton Mercer, soldier,
statesman and philanthropist, is writ large in Loudoun's records.
Already we have read of him in his country home and of his founding
the town of Aldie in 1810;<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> but the brief reference there made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
is wholly inadequate to the man and his accomplishments. Born in
Fredericksburg on the 6th June, 1778, he was the son of James
Mercer and grandson of that John Mercer of Marlboro whom we
have already met.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> His father, after a distinguished career, left at
his death an estate so much involved that the son had some difficulty
in securing his education. He, however, was able to graduate at
Princeton in 1797 and the next year, at the time of friction with
France, was given a commission by Washington as a captain of
cavalry. When the danger of war passed, he studied law and, admitted
to the Bar, practiced his profession with great success. He
served as brigadier general in command of the defense of Norfolk in
the War of 1812, removed to Loudoun, was a member of the Virginia
Legislature from 1810 to 1817 and, as a Federalist, was elected
a member of Congress, in 1816, over General A. T. Mason, the
election being so close, however, that it had to be decided by the
House of Representatives. In Congress he served until 1840, a longer
continuous service "than that of any of his contemporaries." Always
deeply interested in the project of the Chesapeake and Potomac
Canal, he introduced the first successful bill for its construction and
it was in tribute to him that those interested in the plan met in
Leesburg on the 25th August, 1823. When the canal company
was organized taking over, in effect, much of the plant of General
Washington's cherished project the Potomac Company, Mercer
became its first president and continued in that position during the
period of Federal encouragement. Then came the Jackson administration
and its opposition and, as a final blow, the organization of
the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company. The day of the canals
gave place to that of the railroads; but that section of the canal in
Maryland, across the river from Loudoun, was completed and placed
in successful operation, affording to her people better and cheaper
transportation to Washington and Alexandria for their products
than they before had known.</p>

<p>Mercer was an ardent protectionist, intensely opposed to slavery
and an advocate of the settlement of freed slaves in Liberia. He died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
near Alexandria on the 4th May, 1858, and was buried in the
Leesburg Cemetery. On his headstone it is justly reaffirmed that
he was "A Patriot, Statesman, Philanthropist and Christian."<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>Mercer's day well may be cited as the most active and, perhaps,
the most ambitiously progressive in business affairs in the county's
history. Space precludes enumeration and extensive description of
all the enterprises then undertaken but passing mention may be
made of a few. The improvement of transportation was a dominant
motive. Canals, railroads, turnpikes all were instruments to that
end. An early railroad was projected by the men of Waterford and
incorporated in 1831 as the Loudoun Railroad Company to run from
the mouth of Ketoctin Creek on the Potomac "passing Ketoctin
mountain to the waters of Goose creek so as to intercept the Ashby's
Gap turnpike road"; a curious and impractical route it may seem to
us in the light of present conditions and that it was just as well that
the project died in birth. In 1832 another railroad but sponsored in
Leesburg, to be known as the Leesburg Railroad and to run from
that town to the Potomac, also came to naught. At length in 1849
the Alexandria, Loudoun and Hampshire Railroad was incorporated
and built, and under various names has been since continuously operated,
thus giving the county its only railroad communication within
its boundaries.</p>

<p>In 1832 there was incorporated the Goose Creek and Little River
Navigation Company to make those streams available as highways
of traffic. Locks, dams, ponds, feeders, and other appurtenant works
were ambitiously undertaken. With assistance from the State and
the proceeds of the company's sales of stock much construction was
accomplished; but during the Civil War the works were destroyed
by the Federal armies and they never have been restored.</p>

<p>The Catoctin Furnace Company was another ambitious project.
Iron ore was mined in Furnace Mountain, opposite the Point of
Rocks, and for a time shipped away for smelting. In 1838 a furnace
for treatment of the ore was completed on the property and the ore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
smelted at first with charcoal made at the plant and later, as
operations increased, with coke brought from a distance. The business
was highly successful and profitable until ruined by the Civil
War. It was this activity that caused the construction, in 1850, of
the original Point of Rocks bridge across the Potomac.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>Reference to some of the many turnpike companies of the period
already has been made. Undertaken for the profit of the shareholders
as well as the convenience of the people they, for the first
time in her history, gave the county roads fit to bear heavy traffic
and were another exemplification of the energy of the time.</p>

<p>When the church was disestablished after the Revolution it was
agreed that it would be left in possession of her property. As time
went on there arose a clamour among those of other beliefs that
her property and particularly her glebe lands should be sold by the
Overseers of the Poor, to whom the proceeds should go, their argument
being that having been acquired by taxes laid on the whole
community, the taxpayers as a body should benefit therefrom.
Bishop Mead describes what took place in Loudoun concerning Shelburne's
glebe:</p>

<p>"About the year 1772, a tract of land containing 465 acres, on the
North Fork of Goose Creek was purchased and soon after, a house
put upon it. When Mr. Dunn became minister in 1801 an effort
was made by the overseers of the poor to sell it, but it was effectually
resisted at law. At the death of Mr. Dunn, in 1827, the overseers of
the poor again proceeded to sell it. The vestry was divided in opinion
as to the course to be pursued. Four of them&mdash;Dr. W. C. Selden,
Dr. Henry Claggett, Mr. Fayette Ball and George M. Chichester&mdash;were
in favour of resisting it; the other eight thought it best to
let it share the fate of all the others. It was accordingly sold. The
purchaser lived in Maryland; and, of course the matter might be
brought before the Supreme Court as a last resort, should the courts
of Virginia decide against the church's claim. The minority of four,
encouraged by the decision in the case of the Fairfax Glebe, determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
to engage in a lawsuit for it. It was first brought in Winchester
and decided against the Church. It was then carried to the
Court of Appeals in Richmond, and during its lingering progress
there, three of four of the vestrymen who engaged in it died, and the
fourth was persuaded to withdraw it."<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>CIVIL WAR</h3>


<p>It was a happy, prosperous, and contented Loudoun that the
sun shone down upon in 1850. In politics the county was
predominantly Whig and in the growing national issues of
States' rights, slavery and secession, her sentiment clung to the
preservation of the Union; but the seeds of dissension had been
sown. The repercussions of John Brown's insane raid on the nearby
Harper's Ferry arsenal on the 16th October, 1859, were particularly
severe in Loudoun. The madness of it all profoundly shocked
the community and seemed to strike at the foundations of existing
society, law, and order. Yet a dogged adherence to that Union,
which Virginia had been so instrumental in building, persisted.
Little doubt was felt concerning the <i>right</i> of a sovereign State to
withdraw from what had been a wholly voluntary confederation,
but sentiment and a deep feeling of expediency strongly opposed
such action. Elsewhere in the State the tendency toward secession
was stronger. As the fateful days passed, Virginia was torn between
conflicting views. It is probable that the ranting of the extreme abolitionists
in the North drove more Virginians toward secession, and
that against their will, than the most persuasive arguments of its
fieriest advocates.</p>

<p>The Legislature of 1861 recognized the peril of decision in favor
of either side, and the gravity of attendant consequences to be so
great, that it wisely decided to refer the issue to the people themselves.
On the 16th January of that year it therefore authorized that
a convention be called, to be made up of delegates elected from every
county, for the express purpose of deciding upon Virginia's course.
Thereupon such delegates, having been duly elected, the convention
met in Richmond on the 13th February, 1861, Loudoun being represented
by John Janney, at that time and until his death in 1872, a
leader of her Bar, and John A. Carter. Both opposed secession and
voted against it in a convention in which it was apparent that its
proponents held a majority. Nevertheless, Mr. Janney was elected
permanent chairman by a majority of the delegates&mdash;a great personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
tribute to the man and evidence of the respect in which he was held.
Both those who favoured and those who condemned withdrawal
from the Union were given ample opportunity to expound and
urge their views. When the ominous vote was cast in secret session
on the 17th April, 1861, eighty-five of the delegates favoured and
fifty-five opposed an ordinance of secession; but their action was
conditioned upon the majority decision being referred back to the
people of Virginia for approval or rejection. Both Janney and Carter
voted against the measure but even while the convention was in
session a mass meeting, convened in Leesburg, passed resolutions
advocating the proposed ordinance. How great a change had taken
place in the sentiment of the county, during those early and fateful
months of 1861, is shone in the following table of the results in
Loudoun of the election of the 23rd May in which the ordinance of
secession was overwhelmingly ratified there:</p>

<p>The great mass of the American people, North and South, neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
expected nor wanted war. The overwhelming tragedy of it all lay
in the nation being caught and carried on in a flood of events beyond
its imagination or control and these, with sinister assistance from
fanatics and trouble-makers on both sides, brought on the devastating
deluge.</p>

<p>With Lincoln's call for volunteers, Virginia rallied to resist what
she believed to be a threat of hostile armed invasion. The die was
cast.</p>

<p>It is not the purpose of this book to attempt a detailed account of
the war-epoch in Loudoun. Much of her story during those dreary
years already has been recorded by other writers. The full narrative
deserves, and sometime undoubtedly will have, a volume to itself.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as fate had made it a border county, it was inevitable
that intense factional bitterness should exist and that much fighting
should take place within its boundaries; but no major engagements
occurred there. Loudoun at least was spared the terrible slaughter
that destiny staged in Tidewater, the Valley and north of the Potomac.</p>

<p>It required but little imagination on the part of the county government
to foresee the probability of fighting in the county and the
subversion of the civil authority, with the confusion and lawlessness
that would consequently ensue. Therefore the Loudoun Court,
headed by its then presiding Justice Asa Rogers, ordered the county
clerk, George K. Fox, Jr., to remove the county records to a place
of safety and to use his discretion for their preservation. Pursuant to
these instructions, Mr. Fox loaded the records into a large wagon
and with them drove south to Campbell County. For the next four
years he moved his precious charge about from place to place, as
danger threatened each refuge in turn, and in 1865 was able to bring
back to Leesburg every record intact as will appear in the following
chapter. Thus to Mr. Fox's faithful performance of his duty, Loudoun
owes the preservation of her records in happy contrast to the
loss, damage and destruction which came upon the archives of her
sister counties during the ensuing conflict. From a subsequent entry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
in the court's records, we also learn that no court was held in the
county from February, 1862, until July, 1865.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>With the inception of actual warfare the county divided along the
lines forecast by the election in May, 1861. Those sections in which
the Quakers and Germans predominated, continued strong in their
adherence to the Union; the remaining people of the county, with
comparatively few exceptions, were so deeply and unswervingly attached
to the Southern cause as to suggest the burning conviction of
religious zeal. To add to the intensity of hostile feeling, there were,
nevertheless, in all parts of the county, as was inevitable in a border
community, individuals who passionately disagreed with the convictions
of their neighbors and these as occasion offered and to the
detriment of their former friends, reported surreptitiously upon local
matters to the side with which their sympathies lay.</p>

<p>The recruiting of soldiers began among the Confederates, to be
followed in due course by the Union men. "The 56th Virginia
Militia" writes Goodhart "commanded by Col. William Giddings,
was called out and about 60 percent of the regiment that lived east
of the Catoctin Mountain responded."<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> Many of those who thus reported
for duty were put to work, it is said, building the fortifications
around Leesburg, while a number of their former comrades abruptly
left Loudoun for the quieter atmosphere of Maryland.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> But the demand
for men far surpassed the resources of the organized militia.
For the Confederates, new commands sprang into being throughout
Virginia. The 8th Virginia Regiment, Company C (Loudoun
Guard) of the 17th Virginia Regiment and White's (35th Virginia)
Battalion, known as the "Comanches," were largely made up of
Loudoun men and many of the county's sons also were to be later
in Mosby's famous Partisan Rangers as well as in many other commands.
How far flung in the forces of the Confederacy were Loudoun's
soldiers is suggested by a copy of the "Roster of Clinton
Hatcher Camp, Confederate Veterans," (organized in Loudoun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>

<p>In the northern part of the county, Union men joined two companies

independent command raised by Captain Samuel C. Means of
Waterford, under a special order of E. M. Stanton, the Secretary of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
War and later merged in the 8th U. S. Corps. Between the troopers
of this organization on the one side and those of White and Mosby
on the other, some of them former friends and schoolmates, even
brothers, there were frequent and vicious engagements and mutual
animosity ran high, as presently we shall see.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Old Valley Bank, Leesburg.</span></span>
</div>

<p>With the intensity of recruiting, the county was soon drained of
many of its most vigorous and ablebodied men. At that time there
was but one bank in Leesburg&mdash;the old Valley Bank, concerning the
founding of which in 1818 we have read in the last chapter. One
day, so runs the story, there suddenly appeared in the town three
bandits who, making their way to the bank, then located in what
has since been known as the "Club House" on the northwest corner
of Market and Church Streets, proceeded to loot it. Tradition says
that they found and seized over $60,000 in gold and, placing it in
sacks they had provided, fled with it south along the Carolina Road.
The greatly excited citizens hurriedly formed a posse, made up
largely of men who were too old for military service together with a
number of boys, which pursued the robbers so hotly that the latter
left the highway where it passes the woods on Greenway, south of
the mansion, and sought to hide themselves there. Here they were
surrounded in the woods and either made their escape or were killed,
the narrative at this point becoming somewhat vague. Be that as it
may, they disappear from the story and the pursuers turned to recovering
their booty. A diligent search, continued long after nightfall,
failed to reveal the hiding-place of the plunder. With daylight
the search was renewed and, although carried on for many days,
during which much ground was dug over, not a dollar ever was recovered;
but for years the story of the hidden treasure was repeated
and even after the late John H. Alexander purchased Greenway,
long after the war, his children were regaled by the negro servants
with the story of the believed-to-be buried gold.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the work of building fortifications of earthworks, begun
by Colonel Giddings' 56th Regiment of Militia, had so far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
progressed that there were three forts on elevated ground on different
sides of Leesburg. One, known as Fort Evans, named in
honour of Brigadier General Nathan G. Evans, in command of the
Leesburg neighborhood, was on the heights on the part of the
original Exeter between the Alexandria Pike and the Edwards'
Ferry roads, recently purchased by Mr. H. B. Harris of Chicago
from Mrs. William Rogers and Mr. Wallace George; another,
known as Fort Johnston, in honour of General Joseph E. Johnston,
commander of a portion of the Confederate troops at the first battle
of Manassas, (Bull Run), crowned the hill now covered by the extensive
orchards of Mr. Lawrence R. Lee, about one and one-half
miles west of Leesburg on the Alexandria Road; and the third,
known as Fort Beauregard, was constructed south of Tuscarora in
the triangle formed by the old road leading to Morrisworth, the road
to Lawson's old mill and Tuscarora. The property is now owned by
the heirs of the late Mahlon Myers.</p>

<p>All of these fortifications were, at the time, considered of great
potential importance but in the course of events none, save for a
long-distance bombardment of Fort Evans on the 19th October,
1861, were destined ever to be attacked nor, therefore, defended.
The remains of all remain largely in place, useful only as local monuments
to Loudoun's most tragic era.</p>

<p>The principal engagement in the county between the hostile
armies took place in the first year of the war. Soon after the first
battle of Manassas (Bull Run) the Leesburg neighborhood was held
for the Confederates by Brigadier General Nathan G. Evans and
his 7th Brigade made up of the 8th Virginia Infantry under Colonel
Eppa Hunton; the 13th Mississippi, under Colonel William Barksdale;
the 17th Mississippi, under Colonel W. S. Featherstone, together
with a battery and four companies of cavalry under Colonel
W. H. Jenifer, all sent there by General Beauregard to protect his
left flank from attacks by General McClellan, whose forces lay
across the Potomac, and to keep open communications with the
Confederate troops in the Valley.</p>

<p>On the 19th October, 1861 Dranesville, a hamlet on the Alexandria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Road, fifteen miles southeast of Leesburg, was occupied by
Federal troops under General McCall. That evening his advance
guard opened artillery fire on Fort Evans, just east of Leesburg, and
another bombardment began at nearby Edwards' Ferry. Evans thereupon
ordered certain of his troops to leave the town and occupy
trenches he had dug along the line of Goose Creek, to meet the expected
general attack. On the following day, a Sunday, word came to
McClellan that the Confederates were evacuating Leesburg, whereupon
that General sought to make a "slight demonstration," as he
termed it, that is an increased firing by the pickets on the north side
of the Potomac, with, perhaps, a small force of skirmishers thrown
across, to confirm the Confederates in their belief that a general attack
was impending and thus to hasten their complete evacuation of
the town. It was no part of McClellan's plan, apparently, that troops
should cross in force from the Maryland side or that a major engagement
should be precipitated. Brigadier General C. P. Stone, in
immediate command of the Federal forces along the river, nevertheless
ordered a considerable force to cross to the Virginia side, both at
Edwards' Ferry and also at Ball's Bluff, some four miles up the Potomac.
Apparently in ignorance of Stone's actions, McCall, at about
the same time, was retiring his men to their camp at Prospect Hill,
four miles west of the old Chain Bridge. Evans was in the fort bearing
his name. Early in the morning of the 21st, he learned that the
Federals had crossed the river at Ball's Bluff, driving back Captain
Duffy and a small force of Confederates. Thereupon Evans sent
Colonel Jenifer with four companies of Mississippi infantry and two
of cavalry to engage Stone. As a result, Stone's men were pressed
back to the river around Ball's Bluff.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Battle of Ball&#39;s Bluff.</span> (From an engraving published in 1862 by Virtus and Company. New York.)</span>
</div>

<p>In his official report Gen. Evans wrote:</p>

<p>"At about 2 o'clock p.m. on the 21st a message was sent to Brigadier
General R. L. White to bring his militia force to my assistance at
Fort Evans. He reported to me, in person, that he was unable to get
his men to turn out, though there were a great number in town, and
arms and ammunition were offered them."</p>

<p>The Federal force which first had crossed to Ball's Bluff, was composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
of 300 men of the 15th Massachusetts under Colonel Devens.
Later it was augmented by a company from the 20th Massachusetts.
No adequate transportation across the river for a large force had been
provided, so that later it was difficult to send over needed Federal
support. When Evans became convinced that the main fight would
be at Ball's Bluff, he sent forward Colonel Hunton and his 8th Virginia
Regiment of which several of the companies had been recruited
in Loudoun. To these forces there were added, later in the day, the
17th and 18th Mississippi. Sharp fighting, with advantage first to
one side and then to the other, culminated in a Confederate bayonet
charge and the resulting route of the Federals, many of whom were
killed and wounded, others driven into the river and drowned and
by 8:00 o'clock the survivors surrendered and were marched as
prisoners to Leesburg. It is estimated that about 1,700 men were
engaged on each side. The Confederate loss was reported as 36 killed,
118 wounded and 2 missing. The Federals reported losses of 49
killed, 158 wounded and 714 missing. The Confederate dead were
interred in the Union Cemetery at Leesburg; the Federal slain are
buried at Ball's Bluff where their lonely resting place long has been
cared for by the Federal Government.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>Among the killed were Colonel Baker of the Massachusetts troops
and Colonel Burt of the 18th Mississippi. Among the very dangerously
wounded was a young Massachusetts first lieutenant who,
miraculously recovering, later crowned a long judicial career as a venerated
member of the Supreme Court of the United States and conferred
additional lustre upon the name of Oliver Wendell Holmes.</p>

<p>The Confederates were led in the fighting by Colonel Eppa Hunton
of the 8th Virginia. It was he who rallied that regiment when a
part of it was in retreat and turned threatened disaster into victory.
Colonel Hunton had been born in Fauquier on the 2nd September,
1822, of a family long settled in that County. At the outbreak of the
war he was practicing law in Prince William and held a commission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
as brigadier general in the Militia. After the Ordinance of Secession
was adopted, he was commissioned a colonel by Governor Letcher
and ordered to raise the 8th Virginia Infantry. For that purpose he
proceeded to Leesburg and recruited his command. Chas. B. Tebbs
became Lieut. Colonel and Norborne Berkeley, Major. Both were of
Loudoun and Berkeley eventually succeeded Hunton in command of
the Regiment. Of the ten companies in the regiment, six originally
were made up of Loudoun men under Captains William N. Berkeley,
Nathaniel Heaton, Alexander Grayson, William Simpson, Wampter,
and John R. Carter. Of the remaining four companies, one was
from Prince William, one from Fairfax and two from Fauquier. During
the war the regiment covered itself with glory by its splendid
fighting qualities from the first Manassas to Pickett's charge at
Gettysburg and suffered frightful losses. It became known from
these losses, as the "Bloody Eighth." Hunton, shot through the leg
at Gettysburg, was promoted for his valour there to brigadier general.
After the war he lived in Warrenton, practicing his profession
with marked ability in Fauquier, Loudoun, and Prince William
where juries, frequently including members of his former regiment,
seldom failed to give him their verdict. He served as a member of the
House of Representatives and later as United States Senator from
Virginia, holding in his professional and political life the esteem and
affection he had won on many a field of battle.</p>

<p>Acting as a volunteer scout for Colonel Hunton, that day of the
Ball's Bluff Battle was a young trooper of Ashby's Cavalry who,
migrating from Maryland to Loudoun in 1857, purchased a farm
on the shore of the Potomac and became very much of a Virginian.
Elijah Viers White was born in Poolesville, Maryland, in 1832, attended
Lima Seminary in Livingston County, New York, and later
spent two years at Granville College in Licking County, Ohio. With
the restlessness of his age he went to Kansas in 1855 and, as a member
of a Missouri company, had some part in the factional fighting
then distracting that territory. At the time of John Brown's raid on
Harper's Ferry he served as a corporal in the Loudoun Cavalry and
soon after the outbreak of the war was transferred to Ashby's Legion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
By December, 1861, he was a captain, reporting to General Hill,
and in charge of a line of couriers between Leesburg and Winchester.
During the winter of 1861-'62 this force was quartered in Waterford
and, somewhat augmented in numbers, was assigned to scouting
and guarding the Potomac shore. Thus originated the unit which
became so famous in Loudoun's history&mdash;the 35th Virginia Cavalry<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
or, as it was more generally known, "White's Battalion"&mdash;the
"Comanches" affectionately held in local memory. Although having
but about twenty-five men when wintering in Waterford, the
organization increased with such rapidity that before the war's end
its rolls, according to Captain Frank M. Myers, its historian, bore
nearly 700 names. On the 28th October, 1862, it was formally mustered
into the Confederate service by Colonel Bradley T. Johnson of
General J. E. B. Stuart's staff. In its inception formed for scouting,
raiding and other local duty, and regarded as an independent organization,
it was fated in January, 1863, to become a part of Brigadier
General William E. Jones' Brigade and thenceforward continued a
part of the regular military establishment of the Confederacy.</p>

<p>As the fame and exploits of the command and its leader grew, the
latter was promoted major in October, 1862, and lieutenant colonel
in February, 1863. That he was not made a brigadier-general in accordance
with the recommendation of the military committee of the
Confederate Congress was due chiefly to General Lee's personal disapproval
of Colonel White's lack of severity as a disciplinarian. Undoubtedly
his men took advantage of his protective attitude toward
them and incidents of insubordination, desertion, and even mutiny
were not infrequent;<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> but as enthusiastic and fearless fighters they
won and held the respect of both sides alike. How well and dearly
this reputation as warriors was earned is shown by their participation
in no less than thirty-one battles, including Cold Harbor, Sharpsburg
(Antietam), Gettysburg, the Wilderness, Spotsylvania and
Appomattox and in fifty-nine recorded minor engagements as well.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
Colonel White himself was severely wounded on no less than seven
occasions. Such was the esteem in which he continued to be held in
Loudoun after the war, that he was elected sheriff of the county and
also its treasurer. He was a principal founder and the first president
of the Peoples National Bank of Leesburg which position he continued
to occupy until his death in 1907. General Eppa Hunton in
his autobiography has this to say of him: "No man in the Confederate
Army stood higher for bravery, dash and patriotic devotion
than Colonel 'Lige' White."</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, as we have seen, the Loudoun Rangers had
been organized on the territory west and north of the Catoctin
Mountain by Union men and had been taken into the Federal service.
In August, 1862, this command, then numbering about fifty,
was making its headquarters in the small brick Baptist Meeting
House which still stands in Waterford, whence it had been participating
in raids on the Confederate portion of the county. About 3:00
o'clock in the morning of the 27th of August, while a certain number
of the Rangers were away from the church on raids or picket duty,
Captain E. V. White, with forty or fifty men, made a carefully
planned attack on the building and after some sharp fighting, in
which one of the Rangers was killed and ten wounded, the men in
the church surrendered and were taken prisoners and paroled.</p>

<p>On the 1st September the Rangers were involved in another fight,
this time with Colonel Munford's 2nd Virginia Cavalry sent forward
by General Stuart for that purpose, the encounter taking place between
the top of Mile Hill and the Big Spring on the Carolina Road.
The Rangers were at the time reinforced by about 125 men of Cole's
Maryland Cavalry but the Confederates, by getting in their rear and
completely surrounding them, put them to route in a hot sabre
fight. Goodhart, the Rangers' historian, comments that these two
defeats, coming so closely together, almost broke up that organization
and "did to a very large extent interfere with the future usefulness
of the command."<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> It continued in service, however, until the
end of the war, participating in the battle of Antietam, in the Gettysburg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
campaign, and in the Shenandoah Valley campaign in September,
1864.</p>

<p>It was in the same September of 1862, it will be remembered, that
Lee undertook his first invasion of Maryland. He and General Stonewall
Jackson spent the night at the residence of the late Henry T.
Harrison on the west side of King Street, now occupied by Mr. Harrison's
grandchildren, Mr. Cuthbert Conrad and his two sisters.
"The triumphant army of Lee," writes Head "on the eve of the first
Maryland campaign, was halted at Leesburg and stripped of all
superfluous transportation, broken-down horses and wagons and
batteries not supplied with good horses being left behind."<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> It is
said that Jackson rose early in the morning from his bed in the Harrison
house to examine the several suggested points for the Southern
Army to cross the Potomac. He is locally credited with the decision
that the place known as White's Ford was best for the purpose and
it was there, on the 5th September, that much of the Army crossed.
With such a vast number to put across the river, it is probable that
all the ferries and fords in the Leesburg neighborhood were used. It
is well to note that White's Ford and the present White's Ferry
(then known as Conrad's Ferry) are two very different places. The
Ferry is at the end of the road now marked by the State, running
along the south side of Rockland; the Ford is to the north thereof at
the head of Mason's Island. Obviously the depth of the water at
White's Ferry would preclude its use as a ford. Goodhart says Edwards'
and Noland's Ferries were used,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> while the report of the Federal
Signal Officer (Major A. J. Myers) made to Brigadier General
S. Williams, dated the 6th October, 1862, records the Confederates
"crossing the Potomac near the Monocacy, and the commencement
of their movement into Maryland."<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Nevertheless the Confederate
official reports definitely shew that a great number, probably the
major part of the vast host, crossed at White's Ford, including Stonewall
Jackson's own men, General Early's Division (which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
passed through Leesburg the day before and camped that night
"near a large spring"&mdash;whether Big Spring or the old Ducking Pond
of Raspberry Plain does not definitely appear); General Hood's Division,
Colonel B. T. Johnson's 2nd Virginia Brigade, McGowan's
Brigade, etc.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Never were the hopes of the Confederates more rosy;
it is recorded that, as the Army crossed the river, the men sang and
cheered with joy and that every band played "Maryland, my Maryland."
Twelve days later there was fought the battle of Antietam,
the bloodiest day's conflict of the whole war, and on the night of
the 18th September the Confederates, in retreat but in good order,
recrossed the Potomac.</p>

<p>While the battle of Antietam was being so hotly fought in nearby
Maryland, Lieutenant Colonel (later Major General) Hugh Judson
Kilpatrick, advancing from Washington with ten companies of
Federal cavalry, reached Leesburg where there still remained a small
Confederate force made up of Company A of the 6th Virginia Cavalry
and about forty Mississippi infantrymen under Captain Gibson,
then acting as Provost Marshal of the town. Being largely outnumbered,
the Confederates were about to retire when they were
joined by Captain E. V. White and thirty of his men. Persuading
the soldiers already there to make an effort to hold the town, White
and his men exchanged shots with the Federal advance guard; but
finding that Kilpatrick was bringing a battery forward, the Confederates
retreated through the town's streets. Kilpatrick, however, had
already trained his cannon upon Leesburg, thereby subjecting it to
its first and only artillery bombardment and greatly terrifying the
civilian population. Myers records that "shrieking shells came crashing
through walls and roofs" of Leesburg's buildings. The Federal
report avers that but a few shells were fired "over the town."<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> After
this brief artillery fire, Kilpatrick sent a detachment of his 10th New
York Cavalry through Leesburg's streets who came in touch with the
Confederates on the town's outskirts. Here Captain White, about to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
lead his cavalry in a charge, was severely wounded by the fire of the
Confederate Infantry and as his men, in retreat, carried him to
Hamilton, the Confederate Infantry also fell back, leaving the town
to Kilpatrick. By way of souvenir of this little engagement, there still
remains a bullet-hole in the front door of the house on the south side
of East Market street then occupied by the late Burr W. Harrison
but now the residence of his grandson, the Hon. Charles F. Harrison,
Commonwealth's Attorney of Loudoun. According to the official
Federal report, already quoted, the Confederate "force at Leesburg
was principally comprised of convalescents and cavalry sent to
escort them. The whole country from Warrenton to Leesburg is
filled with sick soldiers abandoned on the wayside by the enemy."</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the war Loudoun was, as it now again has come
to be, one of the most fertile, prosperous and best farmed counties in
all Virginia. When the fighting was fairly under way, it, from its
position as border territory, was dominated by one side after the other
but at almost all times was overrun by scouts and raiding parties
from both armies. Her farms and their abundant livestock and produce
offered constant, if unwilling, invitation to these soldiers to replenish
their need of horses, cattle, hogs, grain and forage; and every
account of the period refers again and again to instances of seizure of
these supplies, involving the greatest hardships, as they came to do,
to the rightful owners. It seems to have made little difference as to
which side was temporarily in control, so far as these levies were concerned,
for both Federals and Confederates appropriated supplies
from the farms of foes and friends alike, sometimes, it is true, giving
receipts or certificates covering what they had taken, with a cheerful
promise of ultimate compensation, and sometimes wholly waiving
that formality. Also, as the armies passed and repassed, there were
roving deserters from both sides and "the mountains were infested
with horse-thieves and desperadoes who were ready to prey upon the
inhabitants, regardless as to whether their sympathies were with the
North or South."<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> "Numerous raids" quoting Deck and Heaton,
"made by both armies drained the abundant food resources of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
county. The women and the children were hard pressed for food,
but they met the privations of war bravely and loyally."<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> Head, writing
prior to 1908, when there still lived many whose knowledge of
war conditions in Loudoun was based on personal experience and observation
and who, on every hand, were available for consultation,
says that the people of the county</p>

<p>"probably suffered more real hardships and deprivations than any
other community of like size in the Southland.... Both
armies, prompted either by fancied military necessity or malice,
burned or confiscated valuable forage crops and other stores, and
nearly every locality, at one time or another, witnessed depredation,
robbery, murder, arson and rapine. Several towns were shelled,
sacked and burned but the worse damage was done the country
districts by raiding parties of Federals."<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Col. Mosby, of the famous
Partisan Rangers, adds his testimony, writing particularly of the upper
part of Fauquier and Loudoun:</p>

<p>"Although that region was the Flanders of the war, and harried
worse than any of which history furnishes an example since the desolation
of the Palatinates by Louis XIV, yet the stubborn faith of the
people never wavered. Amid fire and sword they remained true to
the last, and supported me through all the trials of the war."<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>This last quotation brings to our story one of the most picturesque
figures in either army and one whose numerous exploits in Loudoun
and her adjoining counties were truly of that inherent nature from
which popular legend and folklore evolve. John Singleton Mosby
was born at Edgemont in Powhattan County, Virginia, on the 6th
December, 1833. He was educated at the University of Virginia,
was admitted to the Bar and when the war broke out was practicing
his profession in Bristol. Promptly volunteering for service, he became
a cavalry private in the Washington Mounted Rifles and when
that became a part of the 1st Virginia Cavalry, Mosby was promoted
to be its adjutant. Subsequently he served as an independent scout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
for General J. E. B. Stuart until captured by the Federals and imprisoned
in Washington. After his exchange he was made a captain
in the Provisional Army of the Confederate States by General Lee,<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
later a major and then colonel, serving on detached service under
General Lee's orders. During the winter of 1862-'63 he built up his
command known as Mosby's Partisan Rangers (which had more
formal status as the 43rd Battalion, Virginia Cavalry) in the territory
between the Rappahannock and the Potomac, where, for the remainder
of the war, he continued to operate; but the heart of his domain
was thus described</p>

<p>"From Snickersville along the Blue Ridge Mountains to Linden;
thence to Salem (now called Marshall); to the Plains; thence along
the Bull Run Mountains to Aldie and from thence along the turnpike
to the place of beginning, Snickersville."<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>This was the true "Mosby's Confederacy," as it became known,
and Mosby's Confederacy in very fact it was, albeit a precarious and
but loosely held realm. By Mosby's orders, no member of his command
was to leave these bounds without permission.</p>

<p>Mosby's purpose, always governing his operations, is thus described
by him:</p>

<p>"To weaken the armies invading Virginia by harassing their rear&mdash;to
destroy supply trains, to break up the means of conveying intelligence,
and thus isolating an army from its base, as well as its different
corps from each other, to confuse their plans by capturing despatches,
are the objects of partisan war. I endeavoured, so far as I
was able, to diminish this aggressive power of the army of the Potomac,
by compelling it to keep a large force on the defensive."<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>He was amazingly successful. His men had no camps. To have had
definite headquarters would have been to invite certain destruction or
capture. When too hotly pursued, they scattered over the friendly
countryside, hiding in the hills, the woods, farmhouses or barns and
often, if discovered, appearing as working farmers. "They would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
scatter for safety" says Mosby, "and gather at my call, like the
Children of the Mist." Their attacks frequently were made at night;
but whether by day or night so unexpectedly as always to utterly
confuse their foes and keep them in such nervous anticipation of attack
at unknown and unpredictable points that Mosby became to
them a major scourge. Branded as "guerilla," "bushwhacker," and
"freebooter," Mosby stoutly and logically maintained that his
method of fighting was wholly within the rules of war and when
General Custer took some of his men prisoners and hanged them as
thieves and murderers, Mosby, acting on Lee's instructions, promptly
retaliated by hanging an equal number of Custer's men as soon
as he was able to capture them. That appears to have ended the execution
of captured Mosby men, save for rare individual and heinous
offences.</p>

<p>One of the most spectacular and, upon the local imagination, lastingly
impressive forays made by him was the so-called "Greenback
Raid" in which, on the 14th October, 1864, his men wrecked a Baltimore
and Ohio train near Brown's Crossing. Among the passengers
were two Federal paymasters, carrying $168,000 in United States
currency. This was seized by Mosby's men, carried to Bloomfield in
Loudoun, and divided among the raiders, each receiving about
$2,000. It is related that thenceforth, until the end of the war, there
was ample Federal currency circulating in Loudoun.</p>

<p>His men were volunteers, many having served in other Confederate
commands and thence attracted to Mosby by his romantic
reputation and his greater freedom of operation. Numerous Loudoun
men were in the organization<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> but they made up a much smaller
proportion than in White's Battalion or in the 8th Virginia Regiment.
Many of his men were very young. One of these youths who
survived the constant perils which surrounded the band was John
H. Alexander, born in Clarke County. After peace was declared, he
completed his interrupted education, was admitted to the Bar and,
eventually taking up his permanent residence in Loudoun, very successfully
practiced his profession there until his death in February,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
1909. He wrote an interesting book, <i>Mosby's Men</i>, covering his experience
with that leader, which was published in 1907. His only
son, the Hon. John H. R. Alexander, one of the most esteemed and
efficient judges Loudoun has contributed to the Virginia Bench, now
presides over the Circuit Court for Loudoun and adjacent counties.
Two more of Mosby's youths, these both of Loudoun, were Henry
C. Gibson and J. West Aldridge. After the war Mr. Gibson married
Mr. Aldridge's sister. Dr. John Aldridge Gibson and Dr. Harry
P. Gibson, prominent Leesburg physicians, are the sons of this marriage.
Did space permit many others Loudoun members of the command
could be mentioned. The instances given go to show how the
sons of Mosby's Rangers still carry on in Loudoun.</p>

<p>On the 17th June, 1863, Lee's Army was on its way north for its
second invasion of Maryland and toward the fateful field of Gettysburg.
General J. E. B. Stuart, in command of the Confederate Cavalry,
had established his temporary headquarters at Middleburg.
Early that morning Colonel Munford, with the 2nd and 3rd Virginia
Cavalry, acting as advance guard of General Fitzhugh Lee, was
foraging in the neighborhood of Aldie with Colonel Williams C.
Wickham, who had with him the 1st, 4th, and 5th Virginia Cavalry.
While Colonel Thomas L. Rosser was carrying out Colonel
Wickham's orders to select a camp near Aldie, he came in contact
with General G. M. Griggs' 2nd Cavalry Division of Federals made
up of General Kilpatrick's Brigade (2nd and 4th New York, 1st
Massachusetts and 6th Ohio Regiments) the 1st Maine Cavalry and
Randol's Battery. These forces attacked each other with the greatest
determination and courage. Charges were followed by counter-charges
and desperately contending every foot of ground the adversaries
surged up and down the Little River Turnpike and the Snickerville
Road, where two squadrons of sharpshooters from the 2nd and
3rd Virginia Cavalry were holding back Kilpatrick's men. Says Colonel
Munford in his report of the fight:</p>

<p>"As the enemy came up again the sharpshooters opened upon him
with terrible effect from the stone wall, which they had regained, and
checked him completely. I do not hesitate to say that I have never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
seen so many Yankees killed in the same space of ground in any fight
I have seen on any battle field in Virginia that I have been over. We
held our ground until ordered by the major-general commanding to
retire, and the Yankees had been so severely punished that they did
not follow. The sharpshooters of the 5th were mostly captured, this
regiment suffering more than any other."<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>In truth the Federal soldiers had paid dearly for their victory. Dr.
James Moore, who was acting as surgeon with Kilpatrick and afterward
wrote a life of that General, calls this engagement "by far the
most bloody cavalry battle of the war."<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>While all this desperate fighting was going on around Aldie,
Colonel A. N. Duffie, with the 1st Rhode Island Cavalry, was on a
scouting expedition, having crossed the Bull Run Mountain at
Thoroughfare Gap and being headed for Noland's Ferry. His orders
were to camp on the night of the 17th at Middleburg. Approaching
that town about 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon, he drove in Stuart's
pickets "so quickly that Stuart and his staff were compelled to make
a retreat more rapid than was consistent with dignity and comfort."<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>
The Confederate forces at Aldie were notified of the situation and
ordered to Middleburg but Duffie apparently was not aware of the
heavy fighting that had taken place at Aldie. When he at length
succeeded in getting a message through to Aldie, asking reinforcements,
Kilpatrick replied that his brigade was too exhausted to respond,
though he would report the situation at once to General
Pleasanton, in command of the Federals. "Thus" writes H. B. McClellan,
"Col. Duffie was left to meet his fate.... His men fought
bravely and repelled more than one charge before they were driven
from the town, retiring by the same road upon which they had advanced."
But during the night Duffie was surrounded by Chambliss's
Brigade and although Duffie himself, with four of his officers and
twenty-seven men, eluded their foes and reached Centreville the next
afternoon, he was obliged to report a loss of twenty officers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
248 men. Some of these, at first thought killed or captured, also succeeded
in getting back to the Federal lines but the defeat had been
crushing.</p>

<p>After Gettysburg, General Lee's Army passed through Loudoun,
followed by General Meade. Again, on the 14th July, 1864, General
Early, after the battle of Monocacy, crossed with his Army from
Maryland to Virginia at White's Ford. After resting his men in and
around Leesburg he proceeded by way of Purcellville and Snickers
Gap to the Valley.</p>

<p>All this time Mosby had been active in his "Confederacy" and
attacks on the Federal communications also had been made by
White's Battalion when in and around Loudoun. These attacks, frequently
successful and always without warning, had caused great
losses to the Federals and forced them to keep a large number of men
engaged in their rear who badly were needed elsewhere. On the
16th August, 1864, General Grant, determining to end the menace,
sent the following order to Major General Sheridan:</p>

<p>"If you can possibly spare a division of Cavalry, send them
through Loudoun County to destroy and carry off the crops, animals,
negroes and all men under fifty years of age capable of bearing arms.
In this way you will get many of Mosby's men. All male citizens
under fifty can fairly be held as prisoners of war, and not as citizen
prisoners. If not already soldiers, they will be made so the moment
the rebel army gets hold of them."</p>

<p>But Sheridan at that time was far too busy with his campaign in
the Valley immediately to comply. It was not until after his decisive
victory over Early at Cedar Creek on the 19th October, that he felt
he could act. On the 27th November he issued the following orders
to Major General Merritt in command of the 1st Cavalry Division:</p>

<p>"You are hereby directed to proceed, tomorrow morning at 7
o'clock, with two brigades of your division now in camp, to the east
side of the Blue Ridge, via Ashby's Gap, and operate against the
guerillas in the district of country bounded on the south by the line
of the Manassas Gap Railroad, as far east as White Plains; on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
east by the Bull Run Range; on the west by the Shenandoah River;
and on the north by the Potomac.</p>

<p>"This section has been the hot-bed of lawless bands who have
from time to time depredated upon small parties on the line of the
army communications, on safeguards left at houses, and on small
parties of our troops. Their real object is plunder and highway robbery.</p>

<p>"To clear the country of these parties that are bringing destruction
upon the innocent as well as their guilty supporters by their cowardly
acts, you will consume and destroy all forage and subsistence, burn
all barns and mills and their contents and drive off all stock in the
region, the boundaries of which are above described. This order must
be literally executed, bearing in mind, however that no dwellings are
to be burned and that no personal violence be offered the citizens.</p>

<p>"The ultimate results of the guerilla system of warfare is the total
destruction of all private rights in the country occupied by such
parties. The destruction may as well commence at once and the responsibility
of it must rest upon the authorities at Richmond, who
have acknowledged the legitimacy of guerilla bands.</p>

<p>"The injury done to them by this army is very slight, the injury
they have indirectly inflicted upon the people and upon the rebel
army may be counted by millions.</p>

<p>"The reserve brigade of your division will move to Snickersville
on the 29th. Snickersville should be your point of concentration, and
the point from which you should operate in destroying toward the
Potomac.</p>

<p>"Four days' subsistence will be taken by your command. Forage can be
gathered from the country through which you pass.</p>

<p>"You will return to your present camp, via Snickersville, on the fifth
day.</p>


<p>
"By command of Major-General Sheridan.<br />


<span style="margin-left: 10em;">James W. Forsyth,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Staff.</span>
</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; Commanding First Cavalry Division."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>In pursuance of these orders Federal soldiers in three bodies entered
the county on their devastating work. Williamson, himself a member
of Mosby's band and an eyewitness of what followed, writes:</p>

<p>"The Federals separated into three parties, one of which went
along the Bloomfield road and down Loudoun, in the direction of the
Potomac; another passed along the Piedmont pike to Rectortown,
Salem and around to Middleburg; while the main body kept along
the turnpike to Aldie, where they struck the Snickersville pike. Thus
they scoured the country completely from the Blue Ridge to the Bull
Run Mountains. From Monday afternoon, November 28th, until
Friday morning December 2nd, they ranged through the beautiful
valley of Loudoun and a portion of Fauquier County, burning and
laying waste. They robbed the people of everything they could destroy
or carry off&mdash;horses, cows, cattle, sheep, hogs etc; killing poultry,
insulting women, pillaging houses and in many cases robbing
even the poor negroes. They burned all the mills and factories as
well as hay, wheat, corn, straw and every description of forage. Barns
and stables, whether full or empty, were burned&mdash;Colonel Mosby
did not call the command together, therefore there was no organized
resistance, but Rangers managed to save a great deal of livestock for
the farmers by driving it off to places of safety. In many instances,
after the first day of burning, we would run off stock from the path
of the raiders into the limits of the district already burned over, and
there it was kept undisturbed or in a situation where it could be more
easily driven off and concealed...."<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>The loss to the county was enormous. Although many old and
well-built mills, and barns of brick or stone were not destroyed, as is
conclusively proven by their survival to this day, and the devastation
did not equal that in the Valley,<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> yet how great was the aggregate
damage is suggested by a report submitted to the second session of
the Fifty-first Congress (1890-91) in which sworn claims of adherents
to the Union alone amounted to $199,228.24 for property
burned and to an additional $61,821.13 for live stock taken; the report<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
adding that there had been no estimate of the losses sustained
by those whose sympathies were with the Confederates.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> That the
total loss to the people of the County, as a result of Sheridan's order,
was over a million dollars well may be believed&mdash;and this in a community
which had been raided and robbed and levied upon by both
armies, as well as many outlaw bands for over three years of warfare!
The privations and suffering of the following winter and spring can
but be imagined. It may be noted that a Federal Brigade, under General
Deven, established its headquarters at Lovettsville about Christmas
time and that, although his soldiers patrolled all parts of Loudoun
during that winter, yet in spite of all the war-time strain and
hatreds, their relations with the people of the county were far better
than usually prevailed.</p>

<p>"The year 1864 closed with a gloomy outlook for the Confederacy"
writes Williamson and adds that "the winter in Virginia was
very severe and the ground was covered with snow and sleet for the
better part of the season." About all the comfort Loudoun had was
in the repeated rumours of peace to which the people eagerly listened
and repeated one to another.</p>

<p>And so the bitter winter passed and in the spring came Appomattox.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>RECOVERY</h3>


<p>From east to west, from north to south, her farm lands ravaged,
plundered and made desolate, many of her sons dead or
incapacitated by wounds or sickness, her barns, outbuildings
and fences burned, her horses, cattle and other livestock stolen, confiscated
or wantonly driven away, Loudoun presented, in that summer
of 1865, a sad and dispiriting contrast to the fruitful abundance
of five years before. By the terms of the surrender at Appomattox
the Southern cavalryman had been allowed to retain the horse or
horses owned by him; but as the infantry started on their long trudge
homeward, they carried with them little beyond the ragged clothes
they wore and their determination to begin life anew. How slowly
and with what unremitting toil and self-denial the ruined farms were
restored, the fields again made to yield their corn and wheat and
clover, rails split to rebuild the vanished fences, makeshifts at first
and then better structures erected to replace those burned, only the
people who lived through those years of poverty could tell; and on
that slow path upward from ruin and desolation the part borne by
the women equalled, perhaps surpassed, that enacted by the men.
The County still reverently relates the uncomplaining toil and sacrifices
of mothers, wives and daughters during that grievous time.</p>

<p>Bad as conditions were for the majority, they were even worse for
the large landowners, the former wealthier class. Gentlefolk, wholly
unused to manual labor, perforce turned to tasks theretofore the work
of their slaves. The men ploughed and hoed, their women cooked,
performed every household task and somehow kept up their homes.
One of the few bright spots in the drab picture was that dwelling-houses
seldom had been destroyed; thus at least there was human
shelter. Also the small towns and hamlets, having escaped the devastation
of the farm lands, were to a certain extent nuclei from
which the new life could be built.</p>

<p>County government had well-nigh ceased to function during the
war. All those who had borne arms against the United States or
otherwise aided and abetted the Confederacy&mdash;that is, a very definite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
majority of the men of the county&mdash;now found themselves disfranchised;
the minority of Union men, Quakers, Germans or others
who had discreetly avoided acting with one side or the other, controlled
the first local election after the peace. It was held on the 1st
day of June, 1865. The court record, after a long silence and copied
into its books later, begins again on the 10th of the following month:</p>

<p>"At a County Court held for Loudoun County on Monday the
10th day of July, 1865, present: George Abel, R. M. Bentley,
Francis M. Carter, John Compher, Thomas J. Cost, John P. Derry,
Enoch Fenton, Herod Frasier, Fenton Furr, Henry Gaver, John
Grubb, William H. Gray, Eli J. Hoge, Joseph Janney, Alexander
L. Lee, Charles L. Mankin, Asbury M. Nixon, Rufus Smith, Basil
W. Shoemaker, Jno. L. Stout, Mahlon Thomas, Lott Tavenner,
Henry S. Taylor, Michael Wiard, Jno. Wolford, Thomas Burr Williams
and James M. Wallace. Gentlemen Justices elected who
were on the 1st day of June 1865 duly elected Justices of the peace
for the County of Loudoun, and who have been commissioned by
the Governor, were duly qualified as such Justices by William F.
Mercer, one of the Commissioners of Election for said County,
appointed by the Governor by taking the several oaths prescribed
by law."<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>The new county officers were William H. Gray, presiding justice
of the court; Charles P. Janney, clerk of the county; Samuel C.
Luckett, sheriff; William B. Downey, commonwealth's attorney;
Samuel Ball, commissioner of revenue.</p>

<p>On the 11th July, 1865, there appears the following:</p>

<p>"George K. Fox Jr., as Clerk of this Court having removed from
the County the records of this Court, under an order of Court heretofore
made, he is now ordered to return the said records to the
Clerks office as soon as possible."<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>These instructions were carried out by Mr. Fox. For over three
years he had guarded his trust, without opportunity to return to
Leesburg or see a member of his family during that time. He now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
found himself disfranchised; but between him and Charles P.
Janney the new county clerk, who before the war had worked in his
office, there was a strong friendship so that Mr. Janney appointed
Mr. Fox his assistant, in which position he served until his reëlection
as county clerk, which occurred as soon as the civil disabilities of the
former Confederates were removed. He continued as county clerk
until his death on the 14th of December, 1872, at the early age of
forty years. How truly valued was he in Loudoun was shown at
his funeral which is said to have been the largest the county had
known to that time.</p>

<p>On the 2nd March, 1867, the Congress passed that indefensible
Reconstruction Act which was to leave more bitterness in the South
than the war itself, but, in all that followed, Virginia suffered less
than other States of the old Confederacy. Under that act Virginia
became Military District Number One and General John M.
Schofield, formerly the head of the Potomac Division of the Federal
Army, was given command. His choice was a most fortunate
one for Virginia. Of him Richard L. Morton writes:</p>

<p>"He was conservative, just and wise; and it was due to his moral
courage that Virginia was spared the reign of terror that existed
in most of the Southern States during the Reconstruction period.
His policy was to gain the confidence and support of the people of
the State and to interfere as little as possible with civil authorities."<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>General Eppa Hunton came to know him well and between the
two men there developed mutual respect and friendship. Hunton,
in his biography, has this to say of conditions under Schofield's rule:</p>

<p>"Fortunately for us the commanders in this district were good
men&mdash;not disposed to oppress us&mdash;and we had for several years a
fairly good military government in Virginia&mdash;our judges were military
appointees; our Sheriff and all the officers in this State owed their
appointment to the military Governor of Virginia. Our military
judge was Lysander Hill. We had great apprehensions of him as our
circuit judge when he took the place of Judge Henry W. Thomas,
of Fairfax, but Hill turned out to be a first rate man and a fine judge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
He was the best listener I ever addressed on the bench. His decisions
were able and generally satisfactory. He certainly was not
influenced in the slightest degree by politics on the bench&mdash;(Schofield)
tried in every way to mitigate the hardships of our situation
and gave us the best government that was possible under the circumstances."<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>But even Schofield could not protect Virginia from the more
vicious legislation of the unscrupulous radicals then in control in
Washington. At the close of the war the necessities of the situation
were working out, in Virginia at least, a reasonable and moderate
readjustment of relations between the white people and the former
slaves. The negroes looked to their old masters for employment
and the whites, in their own great poverty, gave to them what they
could; and while wages were very low, the negro was assured of
shelter and food. The enfranchisement of the negroes in March,
1865, the establishment of the Freedman's Bureau in the following
June but more particularly the organization of the Union League
late in 1866 broke down the friendly relations between the races. The
representatives of those politically begotten organizations taught the
ignorant and always credulous negroes that the whites were their
enemies and oppressors, discouraged them from working and persuaded
them to ally themselves with the disreputable "carpetbaggers"
and "scalawags" who were perniciously active in their efforts
to foment trouble, for their own profit, between white and black.
The worst results were registered in the eastern and southern parts
of the State where the more extensive of the old plantations and
consequently the densest negro population existed; in Loudoun,
most fortunately, there was little or no racial animosity and the
negroes appear to have been more content and appreciative, as well
as dependable in their work, than in many of the other counties.</p>

<p>To meet the confusion and turmoil in the State and the threatened
complete overthrow of white supremacy, the best and most representative
men in Virginia formed, in December, 1867, the Conservative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Party, drawing its membership from former Whigs and
Democrats alike. In the election of 1869, to accept or reject a new
Constitution, the Conservatives were successful, the proposed Constitution
adopted and the State rescued from fast developing chaos.
It is remembered that in this election John Janney made what was
practically his last public appearance. He had been an outstanding
leader of the Whigs in Virginia, had opposed secession but, at
the end, stood with Lee and many other Virginians in the belief
that coercion of the States by the Federal Government was the worse
evil of the two. Before this decisive election of 1869, he had suffered
a stroke of paralysis; but to set an example to his former Whig
associates, he had himself driven in his carriage to the polls to vote
the Conservative ticket. It was a last and effective act of patriotism.
He died in January, 1872.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>By the Act of Congress of the 26th January, 1870, the civil disabilities
of the former Confederates were removed, Virginia was
enabled to take her rightful place again as a sovereign State in the
Union and a cleaning up of the carpetbaggers and scalawags was
begun; but it is said to have taken nearly another ten years to rid
the people of the last of them in those counties with the greater
negro population.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>In this period of confusion there came to Shelburne parish in 1869,
as its Rector, the Rev. Richard Terrell Davis of Albemarle who
had served as a Chaplain in the Confederate Army and whose
sympathetic ministrations to his new neighbours were of county-wide
solace. About that time the late Charles Paxton of Pennsylvania
came to Loudoun, purchased that part of Exeter which lies
near the northerly boundary of Leesburg and began the building
of the great house which he named Carlheim and which many
years later was to become the Paxton Memorial Home for ailing
children, established and endowed by his widow in her will in memory
of their daughter. Dr. Davis and Mr. Paxton became firm friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
and through that friendship and Dr. Davis' knowledge of those most
needing help, many a poor man in Loudoun was able to earn a sadly
needed living wage during the long construction of Carlheim. It is
remembered that on Dr. Davis' greatly lamented death in 1892, so
deeply had he engaged the affections of his adopted county, the
negroes, upon learning of a project of his white friends to erect in his
memory a suitable tombstone, begged that they too might contribute
to its cost. It was during the rectorship of Dr. Davis, and largely
through his influence, that the building of the present large gray
stone church edifice of Saint James in Leesburg was undertaken.</p>

<p>Slowly, very slowly, the people doggedly fought their way up the
long and often discouraging hill of recovery. The Spanish-American
War, petty in itself, was in its foreign and, particularly, in its domestic
implications, of major importance; for it showed that, with a
new generation of Americans taking its place, the old sectional tears
and rents were growing together and that the national fabric once
again was becoming truly restored. In the last decade of the nineteenth
century there was a notable inflow of new residents, new
money, new determination, which continued with the succeeding
years and of which the most significant result was the vigorous
growth of the horse and sport-loving community in and around
Middleburg, resulting in the development of one of the great, perhaps
the greatest, centers of fox-hunting and horse-showing in
America. It should be here recorded that to the purchase by Mr.
Daniel C. Sands of an estate near Middleburg in 1907 and to his love
of horses and country life, as well as his tireless energy in spreading
among his many Northern friends knowledge of the charm of his
new neighbourhood and building on the Loudoun horse-loving traditions,
existing since early settlement, may be ascribed the great
prosperity and international repute of the Middleburg environment
of today. But the county at large, as well as Middleburg, has reason
to be grateful to Mr. Sands. During his more than thirty years of
residence here he, consistently and continuously, has been not only
one of the county's most constructive citizens but one of the most
generous and public-spirited as well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>Again we are reminded of the extraordinary part horses and the
various sports connected with them play in Loudoun's life. And all
that is no matter of present day chance but the legitimate flowering
of very old and greatly cherished traditions. Archdeacon Burnaby,
in writing of his travels in Virginia in 1759-1760, was moved to remark
that Lord Fairfax's "chief if not sole amusement was hunting;
and in pursuit of this exercise he frequently carried his hounds to
distant parts of the country; and entertained any gentleman of good
character and decent appearance, who attended him in the field, at
the inn or ordinary, where he took up his residence for the hunting
season."<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> One of the ordinaries thus frequented by Lord Fairfax was
West's on the old Carolina Road, just south of the present Lee-Jackson
Highway, and in the territory now hunted by the Middleburg
pack.</p>

<p>The county supports two hunts&mdash;the great Middleburg Hunt,
turning out upon occasion a field of over three hundred riders, under
the joint mastership of Miss Charlotte Noland and Mr. Sands and
hunting the territory around that town; and the smaller but hard-riding
Loudoun Hunt, covering the Leesburg neighborhood and of
which Judge J. R. H. Alexander is Master. In legitimate succession
to those of long ago, annual horse shows are held at Middleburg,
Foxcroft, Leesburg, and Unison-Bloomfield, the great Llangollan
races are run annually on that beautiful and historic estate, while
just over the Fauquier boundary is Upperville with its annual horse
show, the oldest in America. In short Loudoun is and always has been
a horse-loving county and thus very naturally it is widely known as
the Leicestershire of America. Today the raising and training of fine
horses, together with the maintenance of numerous herds of dairy
cattle (especially of the Guernsey breed) the fattening of great numbers
of beef cattle, the raising of hogs, sheep and poultry, the growth
and development on her many hillsides of extensive and well cared-for
apple orchards, all augment the agricultural revenue Loudoun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
derives from her ever smiling fields of corn and wheat, grass and
clover.</p>

<p>In the year 1900 the Southern Railway Company, then in control
of the old Alexandria, Loudoun and Hampshire Railroad, extended
it to Snickersville, encouraged by many people from Washington
and elsewhere who had built summer homes at and around
Snickers' Gap. The railroad company named its new station near the
village Bluemont and the postoffice authorities were persuaded also
to adopt the new name. Thereafter the old but not very euphonic
appellation disappears, save in history and memory of the inhabitants,
and the village became known by its new and present designation.</p>

<p>In the World War the county played its part in a manner worthy
of its heritage. Her sons to the number of nearly six hundred joined
the military and naval forces and during that period the local Red
Cross Chapters and other civilian organizations were active and efficient.
The list of those Loudoun patriots who responded to their
country's call at that time is too long and their services too varied to
be fully recounted here; but no narrative, however greatly curtailed,
should fail to name those who then laid down their lives for their
country. A dignified monument, now standing in the grounds surrounding
Loudoun's courthouse in Leesburg, bears these words in
letters of bronze:</p>

<p>Memory also should be kept afresh of the names of eleven Loudoun
men who between them, for their services in the war, received
no less than nineteen American and foreign decorations: Colonel
Arthur H. Carter, Captain Edward C. Fuller, Major William Hanson
Gill, William R. Grimes, Samuel C. Hirst, First Lieutenant
William P. Hulbert, First Lieutenant James F. Manning, Jr., Colonel
Thomas Bentley Mott, Bryant Rust, Captain Edward H. Tebbs,
Jr., and Lieutenant Colonel Harry Aubrey Toulmin. This list is
incomplete; as given it is copied from the publications of the Virginia
War History Commission, Source Volume I, 1923.</p>

<p>During the war, as Federal Food Administrator of Virginia, there
also served Colonel Elijah B. White of Selma so effectively that
among the recognitions of his work that he received was the Agricultural
Order of Merit bestowed by the Republic of France.</p>

<p>In 1918, in the midst of the war, a new State Administration assumed
the reins of government under the leadership of Westmoreland
Davis of Loudoun who became Governor of Virginia in that
year and whose administration was accepted by the people as efficient,
sound and well balanced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>In culture the county is recovering the position it proudly held
one hundred years ago before ground down by war and poverty. Its
public schools, then nonexistent, now under the supervision of
Superintendent O. L. Emerick, grow and improve and are supplemented
by several excellent private institutions of which Foxcroft,
near Middleburg, has been described and the very successful Llangollan
School for younger children, opened in 1937 near Leesburg
by Mrs. Frances L. Patton (Miss Louise D. Harrison) also may be
mentioned. Loudoun has produced a naval architect of international
reputation in Lewis Nixon (1861-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    ), two well known artists in
Hugh A. Breckenridge (1870-1937) and the late Lucian Powell and
a number of writers upon her history whose works have been referred
to frequently in the foregoing pages. Supplementing her
schools and extending their educational work the county has two
large libraries, the older founded in Leesburg in 1907 as the Leesburg
Library largely through the efforts of the late Mrs. Levi P.
Morton and her daughter, Loudoun's benefactress, Mrs. William C.
Eustis of Oatlands. In the year 1918 the Thomas Balch Library was
incorporated and at once, on land bought for that purpose through
public subscription, the late Edwin Swift Balch and Thomas Willing
Balch of Philadelphia, sons of Thomas Balch of international arbitration
fame (who was born in Leesburg in 1821) began the construction
for it of the beautiful library building on West Market
Street, Leesburg, which so enhances the charm of the town. Mr.
Waddy B. Wood, a Washington architect of recognized authority
on the early Federal period of American architecture, drew the plans
and in 1922 the building was completed and dedicated and the collection
of books of the old Leesburg Library was presented and
moved to the new institution. That collection, since then much enlarged,
now numbers well over 10,000 volumes and is of a very
definite value to town and county.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>
<p>There had been a small library at Purcellville for a number of years
when in 1919 it was reorganized as the Blue Ridge Library and continued
its activities until about 1926. There followed a period in
which the library was closed. Then in 1934, largely through the
leadership of Mrs. Clarence Robey, a Federal grant was obtained
which, with about twice its amount in many smaller private subscriptions,
made possible the completion in 1937 of the present imposing
Purcellville Library building at a cost of nearly $30,000. It
is rapidly augmenting its collection of books and to its primary function
of library is adding that of civic centre, where lectures, concerts
and other entertainments are frequently given and enthusiastically
attended by the people of the neighbourhood. The new building is
expected to be dedicated during the summer of 1938.</p>

<p>St. John's Roman Catholic Church, the first of its faith in Loudoun,
was erected in Leesburg in 1878 and was dedicated on the 13th
October of that year by the Right Rev. John J. Keane who was an
orator of wide reputation and who later became the Archbishop of
Dubuque. Among those most active in raising the necessary funds
for its construction was Miss Lizzie C. Lee of Leesburg. Until 1894
mass was said but once a month by priests who came from Harper's
Ferry, West Virginia. In the latter year it became a mission of St.
James' Catholic Church at West Falls. Later, through the untiring
efforts of Father A. J. Van Ingelgem, masses were said each Sunday.
Father Van Ingelgem continued to guide the congregation and
church until Father Govaert was appointed the first regular pastor in
July, 1926. Soon thereafter the frame church was greatly enlarged
and beautified, largely through the generosity of the late Mrs.
Henry Harrison (Miss Anne Lee) of Leesburg, and was opened
with services conducted by the Right Rev. Andrew J. Brennan of
Richmond. At that same time the attractive rectory, adjoining the
church, was also opened. The Leesburg parish of this church covers
a territory of 2,000 square miles, extends from the West Virginia
line to that of Maryland and operates two missions, one of which is
at Herndon and the other at Purcellville. The Rev. Father John S.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Igoe, a native Virginian who enjoys the affectionate esteem of the
whole community, is the present pastor.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>As throughout Virginia, hospitality is inherent in the people of
Loudoun. Especially is this so at Christmas time when, from early
days, the old English custom of stopping all farm work (save only
necessitous care of the live stock) from Christmas Eve to the second
day of January still obtains. Then scattered Loudoun folk seek to return,
if but for a day, to their native soil bringing back with them
friends and acquaintances that they may show their birthright;
then open house prevails, time-honoured eggnogg and appletoddy
greet all guests and the Leesburg Assembly, following its custom
handed down through the generations, holds its eagerly awaited
Christmas Ball.</p>

<p>With an unusually healthy climate the county is fortunate in the
rarely efficient and devoted corps of physicians, both general practitioners
and specialists, who faithfully guard the physical condition
of its people. Of their number the Virginia State Medical Society
has honored itself and Loudoun by electing as its President Dr. G.
F. Simpson of Purcellville. And to the marked ability of her physicians
is added the Loudoun Hospital, founded in 1912, first occupying
a building on Market Street, Leesburg, and later erecting and
in 1917 moving into the fine modern hospital building it now occupies.
"To Mr. P. Howard Lightfoot's interest and untiring efforts"
wrote the hospital's historian "is due the actual bringing together of
those factors and conditions which developed into the Leesburg
Hospital." Now called the Loudoun County Hospital, it has a large
nurses' home, beautiful grounds, fruitful gardens and withal has so
splendidly grasped its opportunities for service that it has become essential
to the county's welfare. To the physicians of the county,
many very generous contributors and to the selfless and untiring
work of Loudoun's women may all this great success be ascribed. To
add to this full measure, Mrs. Eustis supports in memory of her
mother Mrs. Morton, a visiting nursing service in and around Leesburg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
through which the kindly professional care of a registered
nurse (now Mrs. Louise King) is at all times at the disposal of the
people for cases of an emergency nature or those not needing continuous
attention, entirely without cost to the patient, irrespective of
the desire and ability of its beneficiaries to pay therefor.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>In this all too brief summary of her present day institutions at
least a word should be said of the county's banks. The Peoples National
Bank, the Loudoun National Bank, both in Leesburg; the
Middleburg National Bank, the Purcellville National Bank, the
Hamilton National Bank and the Round Hill National Bank, each
in its community, serves the local interest and all unite in this enviable
record: that not one bank in the County failed during the great
financial depression of recent and unhappy memory.</p>

<p>The exceptionally healthy climate, the rich and well watered
lands of Loudoun, together with the fine sport for horse lovers carried
on through its long hunting season, have proved a potent magnet
to draw new residents to the county. Country homes are constantly
being created or restored and surrounding farms are, for the
most part, self-sustaining and well handled. With Virginia's assumption
of the rôle of a leader in good roads, the old reproach of
impassable highways has vanished.</p>

<p>And Loudoun is proud of her people. It is an American community,
its roots very deep in soil and tradition. It believes that it
occupies that part of the Commonwealth and Nation most conducive
to a sane and healthy life. Its sons and daughters sometimes,
in following the beckoning finger of fortune, wander far afield; but
are prone to return equally convinced with those who seldom leave
the county that all in all no better homeland anywhere can be found&mdash;devoutly
believing that though God might have made a fairer
land, yet remaining strong in their reasonable conviction that God
never did.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
